:Summary: Define schema types and rules with TypeQL.
:keywords: typeql, schema, model, define, modify, extend, type, rule, annotations
:pageTitle: Define query

A Define query extends a schema of a database with new schema statements.

Define queries can be used only in a schema session and write transaction.
For more information on the limitations of a schema session, see the
xref:typedb::basics/acid.adoc#_schema_integrity[Schema integrity enforcement].

For more information about basics of data modeling with TypeQL, see the
xref:typeql::fundamentals.adoc[] page.

== Behavior

// tag::behavior[]
A Define query adds schema statements to an existing schema.
These statements can add new types and rules,
or they can add new properties to existing types and replace existing rules.
It can't change schema statements already existing in a schema, except for annotations and rules.
//#todo Add links to annotations and rules section to clarify

Define queries are idempotent, as in they can be applied multiple times
without changing the result of the initial application.

A Define query should produce a consistent and valid schema in a database,
otherwise it will not pass validation and will be rejected.

Define query returns a Promise of an empty response.
// end::behavior[]

== Syntax

// tag::syntax[]
A Define query consists of a single `define` clause and always starts with the `define` keyword.

Define queries are written in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
define <schema statements>
----

Schema statements in a `define` clause uses TypeQL to declare type definitions and rules.
// end::syntax[]

For more information on defining rules, see the xref:schema/rule-definitions.adoc[] page.
For more information on defining types, ownerships, and roleplayers,
see below and the xref:typeql::schema/type-definitions.adoc[].

[#_define_clause]
== Define clause

A `define` clause is used in a Define query to specify schema statements for new or updated types and rules.
Schema statements in a `define` clause can't use any variables or values.

TypeQL statements are combined by an implicit conjunction (logical `AND`)
so they can be included in a query in any order or even added later with another query with the same result.

Schema statements can use types that already exist in a schema
(including built-in types) or defined anywhere in the same query.
Every statement ends with a semicolon.

Schema statements can be divided to type statements and rule statements.
For more information on type statements, see the xref:typeql::schema/type-definitions.adoc[] page.
For more information on rule statements, see the xref:schema/rule-definitions.adoc[] page.

== Examples

The following examples illustrate the basic syntax of Define queries.
For more advanced examples, see the
xref:typeql::schema/type-definitions.adoc[] and xref:typeql::schema/rule-definitions.adoc[] pages.

=== Define a new type

To define a new type, subtype an existing one.

.Defining a type example
[,typeql]
----
define

credential sub attribute, value string;
subject sub entity, owns credential;
user sub subject;
----

The above example adds three new types:

* `credential` -- attribute type with `string` value type.
* `subject` -- entity type that can own `credential` attributes.
* `user` -- entity type that subtypes the `subject` type and by doing os, inherits the ability to own `credential`.

=== Define a new property

To define a new property for an existing type,
use a Define query with a statement that states the new property for an existing type.

.Defining a property example
[,typeql]
----
define

user owns email;
email sub attribute, value string;
----

The above query adds a new `email` attribute type and adds an ownership of it to the existing `user` type.

=== Define a relation

To create a new relation, subtype the `relation` root type or any of its subtypes.
To add a role in a relation, use the `relates` keyword.
To enable a type to play a role in a relation, use the `plays` keyword.

.Defining a relation example
[,typeql]
----
define

name sub attribute, value string;

membership sub relation,
    relates member,
    relates parent;

user-group sub subject,
    owns name,
    plays membership:parent;

user plays membership:member;
----

The above query adds the `membership` relation type with two roles: `member` and `parent`.
The new `user-group` type then made able to play the `parent` role.
The pre-existing `user` role is able to play the `member` role in the relation now.

////
Instead, they use type labels and TypeQL keywords to express
<<_subtyping,subtyping>>,
<<_abstract,abstract flags>>,
<<_ownership,ownership>>,
<<_annotations,annotations>>, and
<<_roleplaying,roleplaying>>.
