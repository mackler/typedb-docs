:pageTitle: Define rules

Rules are defined independently of types in the same schema.
However, any types used in a rule must be defined in the schema.

They are executed only as a part of xref:typeql::data/get.adoc[Get queries] when the
xref:typedb:ROOT:development/infer.adoc[inference] option is *enabled* in a *read* transaction.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The results inferred by rules are virtual because they exist only within the transaction. They are not persisted
in a database, and any data inferred in a query ceases to exist when the transaction is closed.
====

Read more on rules in the <<_rule_validation>> section below.

== Syntax

Rules are defined in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
rule <label>:
when {
    <pattern>
} then {
    <pattern>
};
----

Use the `rule`, `when`, and `then` keywords for a rule definition.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Unlike other `define` statements for schema definitions, the rule syntax uses patterns consisting of
variables and constraints for **data** instances. For more information, see the
xref:data/match.adoc#_patterns_overview[Pattern syntax] section.
====

[#_rule_validation]
== Rule validation

// tag::rule_validation[]
A rule's `when` clause (condition) can be a pattern with multiple statements, including disjunctions and negations.

A `then` clause (conclusion) describes a <<_single_conclusion,single>> relation or a constraint of ownership of
an attribute (due to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause[Horn-clause logic,window=_blank]).

When using a disjunction in a rule, the disjunctive parts must be bound by variables outside the `or` statement.
These variables are the only ones permitted in the `then` clause.

Since version `2.18.0`, we can use xref:typeql::schema/define-types.adoc#_abstract_types[abstract] types in a rule
as long as all the type variables that define which instances to create during materialization are concrete
(non-abstract).

.See the example with abstract types
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
define

abstract-person sub entity, abstract, plays friendship:friend; #abstract
friendship sub relation, relates friend;  #non-abstract

rule concrete-relation-over-abstract-players:
when {
   $x isa abstract-person;
} then {
   (friend: $x) isa friendship;
};
----
====

The `then` clause of a rule can't use variables (either concept variables or value variables) that aren't defined in
the `when` clause.

The `then` clause of a rule must not insert any instance which occurs negated in its `when` clause or in the `when`
clause of any rule it may trigger. Attempting to define such a rule will throw an error.

Rules will not create duplicates of instances that are already in the database or have already been inferred.
There is no need to check if it already exists in a rule.

[#_single_conclusion]
There are exactly *three* distinct *conclusions* permitted:

. A new relation.
. Ownership of an attribute defined by its value.
. Ownership of an attribute defined by a variable.

The `then` clause must be insertable according to the schema (e.g., we can't give an attribute to an instance
that can't own that attribute type).
// end::rule_validation[]

== Rule processing (inference)

The approach TypeDB uses is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_chaining[backward-chaining,window=_blank]
execution on top of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause[Horn-clause,window=_blank] logic.

Negation functionality follows the set-difference semantics. It corresponds to the negation-as-failure model under the
following conditions:

- We have stratified negation.
- The results are grounded.
- We ensure all variables occurring both inside and outside the negation are bound by the time the negation is
evaluated.

Infinite recursion and non-termination are prevented with a tabling mechanism.

== Examples

=== Basic

[,typeql]
----
define

rule test:
    when {
        $p isa person;
    } then {
        $p has full-name "Dude";
    };
----

The example above demonstrates a simple rule. All `person` entities matched by a read query with the inference option
*enabled* will have a `full-name` attribute with the value `Dude`, even if they have other `full-name`
attributes with different values.

=== Using value variables

[,typeql]
----
define

size-mb sub attribute, value double;

file owns size-mb;

rule size-covert:
    when {
        $f isa file, has size-kb $s;
        ?mb = $s/1024;
    } then {
        $f has size-mb ?mb;
    };
----

The above query defines an additional attribute subtype `size-mb`, defines that it can be owned by the `file` entity
subtype, and creates a rule `size-convert` to create ownership of `size-mb` with the value *1024* times lower than
`size-kb` to any `file` instance that has `size-kb`. The rule uses a
xref:typeql::data/match.adoc#_value_variables[value variable] for
xref:data/match.adoc#_arithmetic_operations[arithmetics].

With this rule defined and the inference option xref:typedb:ROOT:development/infer.adoc#_how_to_use_inference[enabled],
we can try the following query:

[,typeql]
----
match
    $f isa file, has size-kb $s, has size-mb $mb;
    $mb > 1;
----

With the default IAM dataset sample, this query shall return only one result (because all others will have `size-mb`
lower than 1), similar to this:

[,typeql]
----
{
    $f iid 0x826e80078000000000000000 isa file;
    $mb 1.6650390625 isa size-mb;
    $s 1705 isa size-kb;
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The value of `size-mb` is not persisted in the database but instead -- inferred by the `size-covert` rule every time
we do a read transaction with the inference option enabled and query for `size-mb`.
====

=== Transitive rule

[,typeql]
----
define

rule transitive-reachability:
    when {
        (from: $x, to: $y) isa rel;
        (from: $y, to: $z) isa rel;
    } then {
        (from: $x, to: $z) isa rel;
    };
----

The example above allows for the transitivity of relations. We can interpret this rule as joining two relations
together. It creates a relation `x` to `z`, given that there are relations of `x` to `y` and `y` to `z`.

=== Advanced transitivity usage

When inferring relations, it is possible to variablize any part of the `then` clause of the rule. For example, if we
want a rule to infer many types of relations, we could propose a rule such as:

[,typeql]
----
define

rule all-relation-types-are-transitive:
    when {
        ($role1: $x, $role2: $y) isa! $relation;
        ($role1: $y, $role2: $z) isa! $relation;
    } then {
        ($role1: $x, $role2: $z) isa $relation;
    };
----
//#todo Add advanced transitivity page or blog post here

=== Complex rule

[,typeql]
----
define

rule add-view-permission:
    when {
        $modify isa action, has name "modify_file";
        $view isa action, has name "view_file";
        $ac_modify (object: $obj, action: $modify) isa access;
        $ac_view (object: $obj, action: $view) isa access;
        (subject: $subj, access: $ac_modify) isa permission;
    } then {
        (subject: $subj, access: $ac_view) isa permission;
    };
----

The example above illustrates a more complex rule using the IAM schema.

In short, the permission to access some file with the action that has `name` of `view_file` can be inferred by the
rule from the permission to `modify_file` the same file.

The xref:typedb:ROOT:development/infer.adoc#_example[Example] section of Inferring data page gives a full explanation
of how this rule works.
