== Add

We can add types and rules to an existing schema by running new define statements to the same database as usual.

The define statements are idempotent. By sending the same define query twice or more times, the resulting
schema must be achieved as if we send it only once. So types and/or rules will not be duplicated.

A separate define statement for a new type or a rule can be sent as a `define` query. Alternatively, the statement
can be added to the define statement of the existing schema and sent together. Only new types and/or rules will be
added in this case. If we change the name (label) of the existing type or rule in the existing schema and then send it
as a define query, then the changed type or rule will be processed as a new one.
//#todo Add examples. Step by step adding constraints.

== Delete

Use the `undefine` keyword to remove the definition of a type or its association with other types from the schema.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Don't forget to `commit` after executing an `undefine` statement. Otherwise, any changes are NOT committed to a database.
====

[#_undefine_a_type]
=== Undefine a type

To delete a user-defined type from a schema use the keyword `undefine` with the label of a type to delete and `sub`
keyword, followed by the supertype (direct or not) of the deleted type.

[,typeql]
----
undefine subject sub entity;
----

[WARNING]
====
Types with existing subtypes or instances can't be undefined. Undefine any subtypes and delete any data instances of
a type to be able to undefine it.
====

=== Undefine an attribute's association

We can undefine the association that a type has with an attribute.

[,typeql]
----
undefine subject owns credential;
----

The query above removes ownership of the attribute type `credential` from the entity type `subject`. Therefore,
instances of the `subject` type will no longer be able to have ownership over instances of the `credential` type.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It's important to note that if we add the `sub` keyword to the `label` at the beginning: `undefine [label] sub [type],
owns [attributes' label];` it undefines the `label` type itself, rather than just its association with the attribute
type.

For example, `undefine subject sub entity, owns credential;` will delete the `subject` entity type from the
schema. The ownership of the `credential` attribute type by the `subject` entity type will also be removed, but the
`credential` attribute type will continue to exist. To undefine it from a schema, use `undefine credential sub
attribute;`.
====

=== Undefine a relation

Undefining a relation type undefines all of its roles. Therefore, when a relation type is undefined any types
that were playing roles in that relation type will no longer play those roles. Given a `change-request` relation type,
we can undefine it as shown below.

[,typeql]
----
undefine

change-request sub relation;
----

[#_undefine_a_supertype]
=== Undefine a supertype

When a type to be undefined is a supertype to some other types, we must first undefine all its subtypes before
undefining the supertype itself. We can use the same query to delete both the supertype and all its subtypes.

[,typeql]
----
undefine

object sub entity;
resource sub object;
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If we are using the same query to undefine supertype and all its subtypes, we need to make sure to use the supertype
label in the subtypes undefine statements (directly right from the `sub` keyword). Otherwise, query will fail as
invalid, due to one of the deleted types having subtypes.
====

=== Undefine a rule

Rules, like any other schema members, can be undefined. Hence, to delete a rule, use the `undefine rule` keywords
and refer to the rule by its label. For example:

[,typeql]
----
undefine rule add-view-permission;
----

== Rename a type

// tag::rename[]
To rename a type (to change its label), use the xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio] or
xref:typedb:ROOT:development/api.adoc[TypeDB Driver API] rename method for a type class object:
xref:clients::java/java-api-ref.adoc#_rename_type_label[Java],
xref:clients::python/python-api-ref.adoc#_rename_type_label[Python],
xref:clients::nodejs/node-js-api-ref.adoc#_rename_type_label[Node.js].
// end::rename[]

== Modify a rule

To modify a rule, xref:typeql::schema/define-rules.adoc[define a new rule] with the same label.
It will overwrite the existing rule upon commit.
