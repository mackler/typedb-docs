To use a new TypeDB database, we need to define its schema first. We can do it with a <<#_define_query>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To define a schema, a `schema` xref:typedb:ROOT:connecting/overview.adoc#_sessions[session] must be opened,
and a `write` xref:typedb:ROOT:connecting/overview.adoc#_transactions[transaction] started.
The changes must be *committed*, or they will NOT be permanent.
====

There is no limitation in the order of types to define. We can define schema types in any order if the schema is valid.
TypeDB Clients validate our schema definition requests before sending them to a TypeDB
server. We will not be able to commit changes if the resulting schema isn't valid.

// tag::idempotence[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Define queries are idempotent.

Running the same define query a second time shall not produce any changes to the database schema.

Running a modified version of an already executed schema definition query can add concepts to the
schema but mostly can't modify existing ones. TypeQL schema statements do NOT replace existing type definitions but
add missing parts.

Two notable exceptions are:

- **rules** (defining a new rule with an existing label/name will replace the existing rule completely), and
- **annotations**, like the `@key` keyword (which we can remove by redefining attribute ownership without the
  annotation).
====
// end::idempotence[]

[#_define_query]
== Define query

A define query adds new or modifies existing types and/or rules in the database schema.

A define query consists of a single `define` clause.

TypeQL `define` clause must begin with the `define` keyword.

We can run multiple statements as a single query.
The `define` keyword must only be included once per query at the beginning.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This page only covers how to define types.
For defining rules, see the xref:typeql::schema/define-rules.adoc[] page.
====

=== Syntax

Define queries are written in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
define <pattern>
----

The pattern used in the define query is limited to the DDL part of TypeQL as it declares only types (and rules),
but not instances of data.

=== Type definition syntax

This is the generic syntax of the define query for a type definition:

[,typeql]
----
define

<label> sub <supertype labell>
[(, abstract)]
[, value <value-type>]
(, relates <role label>)
[(, relates <role label>)...]
[(, owns <attribute type label> [@annotation])...]
[(, plays <relation type label>:<role>)...];
----

The line with the `value` keyword is relevant only for attribute types definition.

The lines with the `relates` keyword are relevant only for relation types definition.

See the specific syntax for
xref:typeql::schema/define-types.adoc#_define_entity_types[entity types],
xref:typeql::schema/define-types.adoc#_define_relation_types[relation types], or
xref:typeql::schema/define-types.adoc#_define_attribute_types[attribute types] below.

=== Example

////
[IMPORTANT]
====
The following examples define parts of the xref:typedb:ROOT:tutorials/iam-schema.adoc[IAM schema] that will be used throughout
the rest of the documentation. However, some queries on this page result in modification of the original IAM schema
used in the Quickstart guide. These occasional modifications are needed to demonstrate what TypeQL is capable of.

To avoid any errors and/or data loss it is recommended to use a separate database for all examples on this page. For
more information on creating a new database, see the xref:typedb:ROOT:quickstart.adoc#_create_a_database[Quickstart guide].
====
////

[,typeql]
----
define

credential sub attribute, value string;
full-name sub attribute, value string;
id sub attribute,
    abstract,
    value string;
email sub id, value string;

subject sub entity,
    abstract,
    owns credential,
    plays group-membership:group-member;

user sub subject,
    abstract;

person sub user,
    owns full-name,
    owns email;

membership sub relation,
    abstract,
    relates parent,
    relates member;

group-membership sub membership,
    relates group as parent,
    relates group-member as member;
----

The above example can be run in xref:typedb:ROOT:connecting/studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio]. See the
xref:home::quickstart.adoc[Quickstart guide] for full descriptions of the following steps:

. Make sure a TypeDB server is up.
. Start TypeDB Studio.
. Connect TypeDB Studio to the server.
. Create or select a new database.
. Open a Project folder.
. Copy and paste the query code above into a new tab of the *Text editor*.
. Ensure the btn:[Session type] switch is set to "*Schema*".
. Ensure the btn:[Transaction type] switch is set to "*Write*".
. Click the green "play" button to start the transaction.
. Click the "checkmark" button to commit the changes.

//#todo insert real images of icons above

After a successful commit, all the types can be seen in the Type Browser panel in the bottom left part of the Studio
window.

The following query can be run in a new tab in *Schema* / *Read* mode to see the schema visualized as a graph.

[,typeql]
----
match $s sub thing;
get;
----

As the result of the above query TypeDB Studio should display a graph visualization of the schema defined earlier.

possibilities.

[#_define_entity_types]
== Define entity types

=== Overview

Entity types are defined independently of other types, but may subtype other entity types.

Optionally, entity types can:

* Be abstract.
* Own attribute types.
* Play roles defined in relation types.

=== Syntax

Entity types are defined in TypeQL with the following pattern:

[,typeql]
----
<label> sub (entity | <entity type label>) [(, abstract)]
[(, owns <attribute type label> [@annotation])...]
[(, plays <relation type label>:<role>)...];
----

=== Examples

==== Basic

The following `define` query creates a new entity type, `object`, by subtyping the `entity` built-in type.

[,typeql]
----
define

object sub entity;
----

[#_abstract_types]
==== Abstract

Optionally, types can be defined as `abstract`. An abstract type can't be instantiated and must be
subtyped in order to create entities. It exists only so other types can inherit ownerships over attribute types it
owns and the roles it plays. We can use abstract types in queries, expecting to retrieve instances of its concrete
subtypes.

[,typeql]
----
define

object sub entity,
    abstract;
----

==== Owns an attribute

To define a new entity type that owns one or more attribute types, use the `owns` keyword followed by the label of the
attribute type. The attribute types are appended to the entity type definition with commas. Note, attribute types must
be defined before or concurrently (in the same query) with its owner(s). We can add owners later, but we can't
own nonexistent attribute types.

[,typeql]
----
define

object-type sub attribute, value string;

object sub entity,
    abstract,
    owns object-type;
----

[#_cardinality]
===== Cardinality

By default, an entity can have multiple attributes of the same type: zero, one, or many.

By having multiple attributes of the same type we're effectively creating a
xref:typeql::data/insert.adoc#_multivalued_attributes[multivalued attribute] (as if having an attribute type instantiated
with multiple values).

Use the `@key` keyword to limit the cardinality to exactly *one* and add *uniqueness* constraint.
Hence, the instance of the type with key ownership will have exactly one (no more and no less)
key attribute instance.

See the example in the <<_key_attribute,Key attribute>> section.

==== Plays a role

To add roles that entities of a specific entity type can play, use the `plays` keyword.

[,typeql]
----
define

access sub relation,
    relates object;

object sub entity,
    abstract,
    plays access:object;
----

==== Subtypes another entity

[NOTE]
====
All types that are subtyping `entity` built-in type directly or through other subtypes are called entity types.
Instances of entity types are called entities. A similar terminology is applied to attributes and relations.
====

An entity type can subtype another entity type by using the same `sub` keyword, but replacing the `entity` keyword
after it with a label of another entity type to subtype.

[,typeql]
----
define

path sub attribute, value string;

object sub entity,
    abstract,
    owns object-type,
    plays access:object;
resource sub object,
    abstract;
file sub resource,
    owns path;
----

In the above example, the `resource` and `file` entity types are subtypes of the `object`, which itself is a subtype
of the `entity` built-in type. They inherit the `object-type` attribute type ownership from it as well as its
`access:object` role. However, while the `resource` subtype is abstract, the `file` subtype is not. Hence, we
can create `file` entities, but not `resource` entities.

Further, the `path` attribute type will only be owned by the `file` entity type and any other entity types which
subtype it or directly define ownership.

==== Overrides inherited attribute ownership

To override an inherited ownership use `owns` keyword with the new attribute type label, followed by the `as` keyword
and the inherited attribute type label. For example:

[,typeql]
----
define file sub resource, owns file-type as object-type;
----

The new attribute type that overrides inherited type is defined in the schema as subtype of the inherited
attribute type. Hence, the inherited attribute type is abstract and has the same value type as the new attribute type.
The example above in a schema would look like this:

[,typeql]
----
define

path sub attribute, value string;

object-type sub attribute, abstract, value string;
file-type sub object-type, value string;

object sub entity,
    abstract,
    owns object-type;
resource sub object,
    abstract;
file sub resource,
    owns path,
    owns file-type as object-type;
----

In the above example, the `file` entity type owns the `path` and `file-type` attribute types, with the `file-type`
attribute type overriding the inherited `object-type` attribute type.

[#_define_relation_types]
== Define relation types

=== Overview

Relation types are defined independently of other types but may subtype other relation types.
They can be abstract.
Their definition can include ownership of attribute types,
roles other types play within them, and roles they can play in other relation types:

* Owned attribute types are added with the `owns` keyword followed by the attribute type label.
* Its own roles are added with the `relates` keyword followed by the role label. At least one role must be defined for
any relation.
* Roles it can play in other relations are added with the `plays` keyword followed by the relation type label and role.

=== Syntax

Relation types are defined in TypeQL with the following pattern:

[,typeql]
----
<label> sub (relation | <relation type label>) [(, abstract)]
[(, owns <attribute type label> [@annotation])...]
(, relates <role label>)
[(, relates <role label>)...]
[(, plays <relation type label>:<role>)...];
----

=== Examples

==== Basic

The following statement creates an `access` relation that defines two roles:

* `object` -- played by instances of the `object` entity type or its subtypes (e.g.,`file`).
* `action` -- played by instances of the `action` entity type.

[,typeql]
----
define

access sub relation,
    relates object,
    relates action;
----

==== Plays a role

In addition to defining its own roles played by other types, a relation type can play roles in other relation types.

[,typeql]
----
define

access sub relation,
    relates object,
    relates action,
    plays permission:access,
    plays change-request:change;
----

In the above example, `access` relation type can play the `access` role in `permission` relation type and
the `change` role in `change-request` relation type. Besides, an `access` relation type relates an
`object` role (e.g., file) and a `action` role (e.g., read). Thus, a `permission` relation type relates
the `access` (i.e., read + file) and a `subject` (e.g., `person` with `full-name` attribute `Kevin Morrison`).

==== Defines multiple roles

A relation can define multiple roles (from one to many).

[,typeql]
----
define

change-request sub relation,
    relates change,
    relates requestee,
    relates requester;
----

==== Owns an attribute

A relation type can own zero, one, or many attribute types.

[,typeql]
----
define

segregation-policy sub relation,
    relates action,
    plays segregation-violation:policy,
    owns name;
----

==== Abstract

Optionally, relation types can be defined as `abstract`, so they must be subtyped in order to create instances. An
abstract relation type exists only so other relation types can inherit the attribute types it owns and the roles it
defines and plays.

[,typeql]
----
define

violation sub relation,
    abstract,
    owns name;
----

==== Subtypes another relation

A relation type can subtype another relation type by replacing the `relation` keyword with the label of another
relation type. The subtype will inherit all owned attribute types and all roles related or played by the parent type.

[,typeql]
----
define

membership sub relation,
    relates parent,
    relates member;

collection-membership sub membership;
----

In the example above, the `collection-membership` relation type inherits the `parent` and `member` roles defined in
its parent type: `membership`.

[#_overrides_a_role]
==== Overrides a role

The labels of the inherited roles can be overridden to distinguish between the roles inherited by a relation subtype
versus the roles defined by its parent type.

[,typeql]
----
define

membership sub relation,
    relates parent,
    relates member;

collection-membership sub membership,
    relates collection as parent;
----

In the example above, the `collection-membership` relation type subtypes the `membership` relation type and overrides
the inherited `parent` role as `collection`. The inherited `member` role is inherited as it is.

[NOTE]
====
The two examples above can be run one after another. The second one will update the `collection-membership` type to
override one of its inherited roles.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
By overriding an inherited role, we implicitly prevent the sub-relation from relating the role that would otherwise be
inherited.
====

//#todo add another example on inherited overriden roles:

==== Complex example

[,typeql]
----
define

ownership sub relation,
    relates owned,
    relates owner;

group-ownership sub ownership,
    relates group as owned,
    owns ownership-type;

object-ownership sub ownership,
    relates object as owned,
    owns ownership-type;

access sub relation,
    relates object,
    relates action,
    plays change-request:change;

change-request sub relation,
    relates requester,
    relates requestee,
    relates change;
----

//#todo add illustration for this example

The example above defines one attribute type and five relation types:

* `ownership` -- subtypes the `relation` built-in type, and relates `owned`, and `owner` roles.
* `group-ownership` -- subtypes `ownership` relation type, relates `group` as `owned`, and `owner` (inherited).
* `object-ownership` -- subtypes `ownership` relation, relates `object` as `owned`, and `owner` (inherited).
* `access` -- subtypes the `relation` built-in type, relates `object` (e.g., file) and `action` (e.g.,
  read), plays the role of `change` in `change-request` relation type.
* `change-request` -- subtypes the `relation` built-in type, relates `requester`, `requestee` and `change`.

[#_define_attribute_types]
== Define attribute types

=== Overview

Attribute types are defined independently of other types, but may subtype a user-defined abstract attribute type.
Any type can have an ownership over any attribute type.

[WARNING]
====
Attributes owning an attributes feature will be deprecated in one of the upcoming versions and deleted in TypeDB
version 3.0.
====

[WARNING]
====
Attributes playing a role in a relation feature will be deprecated in one of the upcoming versions and deleted in
TypeDB version 3.0.
====

Optionally, attribute types can:

* Be abstract.
* Own other attribute types (this will be deprecated).
* Play roles in relations (this will be deprecated).

=== Syntax

Attribute types are defined in TypeQL with the following pattern:

[,typeql]
----
<label> sub (attribute | <abstract attribute type label>) [(, abstract)], value <value type> [, regex "<regex-expression>"]

[(, owns <attribute type label> [@annotation])...]

[(, plays <relation type label>:<role>)...];
----

[#_value_types]
The following *value types* are supported:

// tag::value_types[]
* `long` -- a 64-bit signed integer number
* `double` -- a double-precision floating point number, including a decimal point
* `string` -- a string enclosed in double `"` or single `'` quotes
* `boolean` -- a `true` or `false`
* `datetime` -- a date or date-time in one of the following formats:
 ** `yyyy-mm-dd`
 ** `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm`
 ** `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss`
 ** `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.f`
 ** `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.ff`
 ** `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.fff`
// end::value_types[]

=== Examples

==== Basic

[,typeql]
----
define

name sub attribute, value string;
email sub attribute, value string;
ownership-type sub attribute, value string;
review-date sub attribute, value datetime;
validity sub attribute, value boolean;
----

==== Subtypes another attribute type

An attribute type can subtype another attribute type if its *abstract*. This is useful when the possible values of
an attribute type can be categorized, and applications can benefit from querying entities and relations not only by
a value of an attribute but also by a label of attribute type.

[IMPORTANT]
====
An attribute type can only subtype an abstract attribute type. However, the subtype of an attribute type can itself be
abstract. Further, an attribute subtype must have the same **value type** as its parent attribute type. Note, the
**value type** of an attribute subtype can be omitted in its definition. It will be inherited from its parent
attribute type.
====

[,typeql]
----
define

id sub attribute, abstract, value string;
email sub id, value string;
name sub id, value string;
path sub id, value string;
number sub id, value string;
----

The above example creates an attribute type, `id`. However, because different entities can be identified by different
information, the `id` type is subtyped by `email`, `name`, `path`, and `number` types -- making it possible to query
users by `email`, business units by `name`, files by `path` and records by `number`.

[#_unique_attribute]
==== Unique attribute annotation

Use the `@unique` keyword to add *uniqueness* constraint to the ownership of an attribute.
This prevents two instances of the same type from owning the same attribute instance (with the same value).

[,typeql]
----
define

object-type sub attribute, value string;

object sub entity,
    abstract,
    owns object-type @unique;
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `@unique` annotation allows us to declare that an attribute instance may not be owned more than once by the
owner type. But no <<_cardinality,cardinality>> restriction is generated from `@unique` annotation.
====

Unique annotation can be inherited, even using override of an ownership.

.See example
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
define

organisation sub entity,
    abstract,
    owns organisation-id @unique;

organisation-id sub attribute, abstract, value string;

non-profit sub organisation,
    owns nonprofit-id as organisation-id;

nonprofit-id sub organisation-id, value string;
----
In this example `non-profit` owns `nonprofit-id` with unique constraint. It's inherited from `organizatrion-id`.
====

[#_key_attribute]
==== Key attribute annotation

Use the `@key` keyword to set the owned attribute as key.
That limits the cardinality to exactly *one* and adds *uniqueness* constraint.
Hence, the instance of the type with attribute ownership with `@key` annotation will have exactly one
(no more and no less) key attribute instance, and it will be unique for all instances of the same type.

[,typeql]
----
define

object-type sub attribute, value string;

object sub entity,
    abstract,
    owns object-type @key;
----

[WARNING]
====
An ownership can't have both `@unique` and `@key` at the same time.
====

==== Regular expressions

The values of an attribute type can be restricted using Java regular expressions. For example, to constrain it to a
set of options.

[,typeql]
----
define

visibility sub attribute, value string, regex "^(public|private|closed)$";
----

The above example defines an attribute type: `visibility`. It is intended for user groups, and specifies a regex to
restrict its values to `public`, `private` and `closed`.

==== Owns other attribute types

While it is more common for entity and relation types to own attributes, attribute types can also own (other)
attribute types.

[WARNING]
====
Attributes owning an attributes feature will be deprecated in one of the upcoming versions and deleted in TypeDB
version 3.0.
====

[,typeql]
----
define

symlink sub attribute, value string;

filepath sub attribute,
    value string,
    owns symlink;
----

The above example creates an attribute type `filepath`, intended for files. It is assumed there can be multiple copies
of a `file`, each with its own `filepath` -- and symlinks can be created that point to these filepaths. Thus, the
`filepath` attribute type (and NOT the `file` entity type) owns the `symlink` attribute type.

==== Plays a role

While it is more common for the roles in relations to be played by entities or other relations, they can also be played
by attributes.

[WARNING]
====
Attributes playing a role in a relation feature will be deprecated in one of the upcoming versions and deleted in
TypeDB version 3.0.
====

[,typeql]
----
define

credential sub attribute,
    value string,
    plays change-request:change;
----

The above example creates the `credential` attribute type, and specifies it can play the role of `change` in
the `change-request` relation type. While `change-requests` were intended to manage access changes, they can now be
used to manage `credential` changes as well.
