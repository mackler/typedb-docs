:pageTitle: Get query

A get query retrieves concepts from a TypeDB database that you can further process with the Driver API.

It should be used in read transactions,
and it can be used with rule-based xref:typedb::fundamentals/inference.adoc[inference].

A Get query triggers a search in a database based on the xref:typeql::data/basic-patterns.adoc[pattern] in the
`match` clause. It retrieves concepts and values from a database. The result of a get query can vary depending on the
query. <<_modifiers,Modifiers>>, including <<_aggregation,aggregation>> and <<_group,grouping>>, can drastically change
the response format. See the xref:typedb:ROOT:development/response.adoc[Response interpretation] page.

[NOTE]
====
Get queries were previously known as Match queries.

The query's name has been changed, but TypeDB Driver API can still lag behind (for backward compatibility),
using the old terminology in its methods.
====

== Syntax

Get queries are written in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,bash]
----
match <pattern>
[get <variable> [(, <variable>)...];]
[sort <variable> [asc|desc];]
[offset <value>;]
[limit <value>;]
[group <variable>;]
[count;] [sum|max|min|mean|median|std <variable>;]
----

For more information on `match` clause patterns, see the
xref:data/basic-patterns.adoc#_patterns_overview[Pattern syntax] section.
//#todo update the link after introducing the Match clause page

[IMPORTANT]
====
A `get` clause works like a filter for variables in matched answers. Get query without a `get` clause will have all
variables mentioned in the `match` clause pattern returned as concepts in every answer.
====

Modifiers, like aggregation functions and grouping, must be at the end of the query and do not require an explicit
`get` clause.

[#_variables]
== Variables

A `get` clause is used to specify which variables (concept variables and/or value variables) to include in the results.
If omitted, every variable is included.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has full-name "Kevin Morrison", has email $e;
get $e;
----

This example query contains the following variables:

* `$p`
* `$e`

The `full-name` attribute is not bound to a variable in this query.

The example above matches person (`$p`) with a `full-name` attribute value of `Kevin Morrison` and `email` attribute
with any value (`$e`). The `get` clause then filters the results to receive only the `email` (`$e`) attributes.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $pe ($x, $y) isa permission;
  $x isa person, has full-name $x-n;
  $x-n contains "Kevin";
  $y (object: $o, action: $act) isa access;
  $act has name $act-n;
  $o has path $o-fp;
get $x-n, $act-n, $o-fp;
----

The example above uses a `match` clause to do the following:

. Finds `permission` relation (`$pe`) of `$x` and `$y` variables.
. Finds `$x` as `person` entities that have the `full-name` attribute with the value of `$x-n`.
. `$x-n` should contain the string `Kevin`.
. Finds `access` relation of `$o` as object and `$act` as action.
. `$act` should have the `name` attribute with the value of `$act-n`.
. `$o` should have the `path` attribute with the value of `$o-fp`.

The `get` clause then filters the answers from the `match` clause to get only the `full-name` attribute (`$x-n`)
of the `person` type, the `name` attribute (`$act-n`) of the `action` type, and the `path` (`$o-fp`) of the `object`.
Every returned result should contain all three concepts.

[#_number_of_answers]
== Number of answers

The number of answers returned by the Get query depends on:

* The number of matched results by the match clause. See the <<_answers_example_1,example #1>> below and the
xref:typeql::data/basic-patterns.adoc#_solutions[Pattern matching essentials] page.
* The number of results returned after filtering with the `get` clause. See the <<#_answers_example_2,example #2>>
below.

[#_answers_example_1]
=== Example #1: Permutations

For example, if we have *three* `person` entities and *ten* `file` entities in a database with the IAM schema and
send the following get query:

//#todo Replace the example to exclude the disjoint match pattern
//it can be a relation like $f($x,$y) isa friendship
//or an attribute ownership, like $x has $y
[,typeql]
----
match
  $x isa person;
  $f isa file;
get $x, $f;
----

How many results are we expecting to retrieve from a database?

[NOTE]
====
Spoiler: **13** is the wrong answer here.
====

As the example above doesn't have any <<_modifiers,modifiers>>, <<_aggregation,aggregation>>, or <<_group,grouping>>,
the number of results will depend on the number of matched solutions for the pattern in the `match` clause. So the
TypeDB query processor will explore all possible solutions: each consisting of one `person` entity
and one `file` entity. There are only `3 * 10 = 30` possible combinations of person and file entities, so we will
get *30* results.

See the xref:data/basic-patterns.adoc#_patterns_overview[Patterns overview] section of the Matching patterns page for
more information.

[#_answers_example_2]
=== Example #2: Variables filtering

Given the following schema:

[,typeql]
----
define

person sub entity,
  owns name,
  owns age,
  owns certified-fortune-teller;

name sub attribute, value string;
age sub attribute, value long;
certified-fortune-teller sub attribute, value boolean;
----

Let's explore the following query:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has name `Bob`, has age 31, has certified-fortune-teller $cft;
get
  $p, $cft;
----

The above query will find every `person` entity that has ownership over the instance of the attribute type `name` with
the value of `Bob`, ownership of the `age` with the value of `31` and the ownership of the `certified-fortune-teller`
attribute with any value.

With the `get` clause, we filter the results to get the `person` instances and the corresponding
`certified-fortune-teller` attribute (represented by the `$cft` variable in the pattern) for every matched result
in a database.

[#_explanation_of_filter]
Why not filter for just the `$cft` variable instead?

That can drastically alter the returned results as the returned results are deduplicated by design. See the
xref:typeql:ROOT:data/basic-patterns.adoc#_solutions[Basic patterns] page for more information on the number of results
for pattern matching.

For example, let's say we have ten people with the name `Bob` and age `31` in our database. Five of them have
`certified-fortune-teller` with the value `false`, one has it as `true`, and the rest don't have ownership of the
attribute.

To insert this dataset with anything xref:clients::overview.adoc[other] than xref:clients::studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio] --
make sure to send every line, except from comments, as a separate insert query. In TypeDB Studio we can just paste the
TypeQL in the text editor and send all the queries by a single run button click in a data/write mode. Make sure to
commit the changes in any client.

[,typeql]
----
  # These are the 5 instances of people with name Bob, age 31 and not cretified fortune tellers
  insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has age 31, has certified-fortune-teller false;
  insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has age 31, has certified-fortune-teller false;
  insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has age 31, has certified-fortune-teller false;
  insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has age 31, has certified-fortune-teller false;
  insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has name "Bobby", has age 31, has certified-fortune-teller false;

  # This is the one and only instance of a person with name Bob, age 31 and a cretified fortune teller
  insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has age 31, has certified-fortune-teller true;

  # These are the 4 instances of people with name Bob, age 31. No ownership of the boolean attribute
  insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has age 31;
  insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has name "Robert Jr.", has age 31;
  insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has age 31;
  insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has age 31;

  # These are some random people, that doesn't meet pattern (Name: Bob and Age: 31)
  insert $p isa person, has name "Bob", has age 20;
  insert $p isa person, has name "Alex", has age 78, has certified-fortune-teller false;
  insert $p isa person, has name "Alice", has age 31, has certified-fortune-teller true;
  insert $p isa person;
----

====

Those that don't have the attribute ownership won't be matched by the `match` clause at all. So we expect to get *six*
results in the original query: five `person` instances owning the attribute with value `false` and one with `true`.

If we use `get $cft;` clause instead, we'll get only two results in response because we will only get
`certified-fortune-teller` instances, and there are only two of those: an instance with the `true` value and another
instance of the type with the `false` value.

The five instances of `person` type all have ownership over the
xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc#_attribute_types[same instance] of the `certified-fortune-teller` attribute type
with the value `false`.

To get all the results, we add the `person` type instances to the answer because those are unique.
Even if some of them might have the exact same set of owned attributes, instances of the `person` type are
different instances nonetheless.

To try the get queries in that example, we need to load the <<_answers_example_2,schema>> and
the <<_answers_example2_dataset,dataset>> provided above into a TypeDB database first.

[#_modifiers]
== Modifiers

[#_limit_the_results]
=== Limit the results

Use the `limit` keyword followed by a positive integer to limit the number of results (answers) returned.

[,typeql]
----
match $p isa person;
get $p;
limit 1;
----

This query returns only one single (and random) instance of type `person`. Consider using `limit` with
<<_sort_the_answers,sorting aggregation>> to receive less random and more predictable results.

[#_sort_the_answers]
=== Sort the answers

Use the `sort` keyword followed by a variable to sort the answers using a variable mentioned in the first argument. A
second argument is optional and determines the sorting order: `asc` (ascending, by default) or `desc` (descending).

[,typeql]
----
match $p isa person, has full-name $n;
get $n;
sort $n asc;
----

This query returns all `full-name` attributes of all `person` entities, sorted by the value of `full-name` in ascending
order.

To sort by multiple variables, use the same syntax and add additional variables and optional sorting order arguments
with a comma separator.

For example:

[,typeql]
----
match $p isa person, has full-name $n, has email $e;
get $n, $e;
sort $n asc, $e desc;
----

The example above will return all `full-name` and `email` attributes of all `person` entities, sorted by their
`full-name` in ascending order first and then by `email` in descending order.

[#_offset_the_answers]
=== Offset the answers

Use the `offset` keyword followed by the number to offset the answers. This is commonly used with the `limit`
keyword to return a desired range of answers. Don't forget to <<_sort_the_answers,sort>> the results to ensure
predictable and deterministic results.

[,typeql]
----
match $p isa person, has full-name $n;
get $n;
sort $n asc;
offset 6; limit 10;
----

This sorts the `full-name` attributes of all `person` entities in ascending order, skips the first six, and returns up
to the next ten.

[#_group]
=== Group

We use the `group` function, optionally followed by another aggregate function, to group the answers by the
specified matched variable.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $pe ($x, $y) isa permission;
  $x isa person, has full-name $x-n;
  $y (object: $o, action: $act) isa access;
  $act has name $act-n;
  $o has path $o-fp;
get $x-n, $act-n, $o-fp;
sort $o-fp asc;
limit 3;
group $o-fp;
----

This query returns the `full-name` attributes of all `person` entities, the `path` attributes of the `object` entities
in any `access` relations that are part of the `permission` relation with the `person` entities, and the `name`
attribute of the `action` entity in those `access` relations. The results are then sorted by the `path` attribute in
ascending order, limited by only the first three results, and grouped by `path` variable values.

The following or similar result can be obtained by running the query above without inference on the TypeDB server with
the IAM schema and dataset from the xref:home::quickstart.adoc[Quickstart guide].

[,typeql]
----
"LICENSE" isa path => {
    {
        $act-n "modify_file" isa name;
        $x-n "Pearle Goodman" isa full-name;
        $o-fp "LICENSE" isa path;
    }    {
        $act-n "modify_file" isa name;
        $x-n "Kevin Morrison" isa full-name;
        $o-fp "LICENSE" isa path;
    }
}
"README.md" isa path => {
    {
        $act-n "modify_file" isa name;
        $x-n "Pearle Goodman" isa full-name;
        $o-fp "README.md" isa path;
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
There can be a difference in the `full-name` value for the `README.md` file since we used `sort` by the `path` and
not the `full-name`.
====

[#_aggregation]
=== Aggregation

Aggregation performs a calculation on a set of values and returns a single value.

TypeDB supports the following types of aggregation:

* <<_count>>
* <<_sum>>
* <<_maximum>>
* <<_minimum>>
* <<_mean>>
* <<_median>>
* <<_standard_deviation>>

To perform aggregation in TypeDB, we first write a xref:queries.adoc#_match[match clause] to describe the set of
data, then follow that by get to retrieve a distinct set of answers based on the specified variables, and lastly, an
aggregate function to perform aggregation on the variable of interest.

[NOTE]
====
Aggregation uses data returned by the query to perform the calculation. For example:
====

[#_count]
==== Count

Use the count keyword to get the number of the specified matched variable.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $o isa object, has path $fp;
get $o, $fp; count;
----

[NOTE]
====
The `count` function is applied to every result returned. If more than one variable is mentioned in `get`, then `count`
will show the number of unique combinations of results. This is also the case when no `get` clause is added,
which actually means that all matched variables are included.
====

[,typeql]
----
match
  $pe ($x, $y) isa permission;
  $x isa person, has full-name $x-n;
  $y (object: $o, action: $act) isa access;
  $act has name $act-n;
  $o has path $o-fp;
get $x-n, $act-n, $o-fp; group $o-fp; count;
----

This query returns the total count of `person` instances that have `full-name` as well as any `access` to an `object`
with `path` and with a `valid action` for every group (grouped by the `path` of the `object`).

[NOTE]
====
The `group` clause should go before the aggregation function.
====

[#_sum]
==== Sum

Use the `sum` keyword to get the sum of the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched variable.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s;
sum $s;
----

[WARNING]
====
Omitting the variable `$f` in the `get` clause of the above query will result in missing all duplicated values
of `$s` from the aggregation.

For more information, see the xref:data/basic-patterns.adoc#_solutions[Matching patterns] page.
====

[#_maximum]
==== Maximum

Use the `max` keyword to get the maximum value among the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched variable.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s; max $s;
----

[#_minimum]
==== Minimum

Use the `min` keyword to get the minimum value among the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched variable.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s; min $s;
----

[#_mean]
==== Mean

Use the `mean` keyword to get the average value of the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched variable.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s; mean $s;
----

[#_median]
==== Median

Use the `median` keyword to get the median value among the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched variable.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s; median $s;
----

[#_standard_deviation]
==== Standard deviation

Use the `std` keyword to get the standard deviation value among the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched
variable. This is usually used with the average value and returned by the mean keyword.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s; std $s;
----
