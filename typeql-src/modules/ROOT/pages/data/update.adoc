:pageTitle: Update query

An update is actually a `match-delete-insert` query, and it removes and then adds data based on the `match`, `delete`,
and `insert` patterns.

Unlike other databases, TypeDB does not update data in place. Data is updated by
replacing references to it. In relations, when a player is removed from a role, the player itself is not removed from
the database.

In addition, attributes are immutable. Rather than changing the value of an owned attribute,
the ownership of it is replaced with the ownership of a new/different attribute.

== Syntax

Updates are written in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
match <pattern>
delete <pattern>
insert <pattern>
----

The `match` clause uses patterns to find existing data/references to be changed. The `delete` clause uses a pattern
to specify which data/references found by the `match` clause should be removed. The `insert` clause uses a pattern
to specify the data/references which will replace it.

[NOTE]
====
A pattern consists of variables and constraints for concepts. For more information, see the
xref:data/match.adoc#_patterns_overview[Pattern syntax] section.
====

The number of deleted and inserted concepts depends on the number of answers matched by the `match` clause. The `delete`
clause, as well as the `insert` clause, will be executed once per every matched answer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If there are no matches for a `match` clause in an update (`match-delete-insert`) query, then there will be no deletes
and no inserts.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `delete` clause can have multiple statements in its pattern to delete in one query. But it can't delete types (use
xref:schema/modify.adoc#_undefine_a_type[undefine] to delete types) and can't have the following:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Negation
- `is` keyword
====

[NOTE]
====
The `insert` clause can have multiple statements in its pattern to insert in one query. But it can't insert types (use
xref:schema/define-types.adoc[define] to insert new types) and can't have the following:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Negation
- `is` keyword
====

== Updating attribute values

=== Replacing ownership

In many cases, the desired effect is to change the value of an owned attribute. We can't change the value of an
attribute as attributes are immutable, but we can change the owned attribute. To update an attribute owned by an
entity, its ownership must first be removed. Then, the entity can be assigned ownership of an attribute with a
different value. It can be an existing attribute or a new one.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has full-name "Masako Holley", has email $email;
delete
  $p has $email;
insert
  $p has email "m.holley@vaticle.com";
----

The above query does the following:

. Finds all `person` entities (`$p`) that have a `full-name` attribute with a value of `Masako Holley`.
. Deletes `$p``'s ownership of its current `email` attribute.
. Makes `$p` the owner of an `email` attribute with a value of `m.holley@vaticle.com`.

If there is an existing `email` attribute with a value of `m.holley@vaticle.com`, the matching `person` entities will
now own it. Otherwise, a new one will be created and owned by the matching `person` entities.

[NOTE]
====
An `email` attribute with the previous value of `masako.holley@vaticle.com` will still exist, but it will no longer be owned by the matching `person` entities.
====

=== Replacing attributes

There may be times when the desired effect is to change the value of multiple owned attributes, all of the same type.
This is done by removing them and inserting the ownership of a new/different attribute.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has full-name $n;
  $n contains "inappropriate word";
delete
  $n isa full-name;
insert
  $p has full-name "deleted";
----

The above query:

. Finds all `person` entities (`$p`) with at least one owned `full-name` attribute (`$n`).
. Filters `$n` (and consequently `$p`) to only those that contain the string `inappropriate word`.
. Removes these `full-name` attributes that contain the string from the database.
. Makes `$p` (all entities of person that had `full-names` that contained the string) the owners of a `full-name`
attribute with a value of `deleted`.

If a similar query has been run before, there may be an existing attribute with a value of `deleted`, which the matching
`person` entities will now own. If not, a new `full-name` attribute will be inserted, and the matching `person` entities
will own it.

[NOTE]
====
After running the above query, there will be a single `full-name` attribute with a value of `deleted`, which is owned by
the matching entities, and any `full-name` attributes which had contained the string `inappropriate word` will no
longer exist.
====

== Updating a relation's role player

To replace a role player, we combine the steps for extending the relation with steps for deleting a role player:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has full-name "Pearle Goodman";
  $a_write isa action, has name "modify_file";
  $a_read isa action, has name "view_file";
  $ac_write (object: $o, action: $a_write) isa access;
  $ac_read (object: $o, action: $a_read) isa access;
  $pe (subject: $p, access: $ac_write) isa permission;
delete
  $pe (access: $ac_write);
insert
  $pe (access: $ac_read);
----

The above query does the following:

. Finds a `person` entity (`$p`) with a `full-name` of `Pearle Goodman`.
. Finds an `action` entity (`$a_write`) with `name` of `modify_file`).
. Finds an `action` entity (`$a_read`)  with `name` of `read_file`).
. Finds all `access` relations (`$ac_write`) that relate any `object` (as `object`) to `$a_write` (as `action`).
. Finds all `access` relations (`$ac_read`) that relate any `object` (as `object`) to `$a_read` (as `action`).
. Finds all permissions (`$pe`) that relate `$p` (as `subject`) to `$ac_write` (as `access`).
. Removes all write accesses (`$ac_write`) as a player of the `access` role in matching permission relations
(`$pe`).
. Adds all read accesses (`$ac_read`) as a player of the `access` role in matching permission relations (`$pe`).

In short, all of Pearle Goodman's permissions with write access will become permissions with read access.

[NOTE]
====
After running the above query, all matched `access` relations `$ac_write` with `$a_write` as `action` still
exist but no longer play a role in the matched `permission` relations.
