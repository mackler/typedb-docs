== Introduction

Vaticle maintains TypeDB Studio, TypeDB Console, and Drivers for Java, Python, and NodeJS. The TypeDB Rust Driver is
under development.
All our other TypeDB Clients or Drivers are community-built.

It's possible to build a TypeDB Driver for any language. A TypeDB Driver fundamentally is a lightweight frontend
to the TypeDB server. This page is a guide for the components and protocols that need to be implemented.

[NOTE]
====
TypeDB Driver is an important part of any TypeDB Client. We will use both terms in this page, and it's important not
to be confused by what is what.

*TypeDB Client* -- any software that can connect to TypeDB and provide us with some kind of interface we
can use: API, CLI, or GUI.

*TypeDB Driver* -- a library that implements TypeDB Driver RPC protocol to connect to TypeDB and provides an API to
use it. Usually, Drivers are used as a part of other applications to connect to TypeDB.

For convenience, the term TypeDB Clients includes all TypeDB Drivers.
====

== TypeDB Driver architecture

TypeDB Drivers adhere to a common architecture. This greatly reduces the workload of
maintaining them, so we also recommend community contributions to follow the same basic structure.

=== Code structure

The following diagram shows all the packages (directories) in Java Driver and their dependency graph:

image::package-structure.png[Driver Package Structure]

The entry point is the root package, in this case named `driver-java`.
`api` is where we declare all the available driver methods -- basically all the interfaces.
`connection` holds core driver and enterprise driver with all the basic building blocks: driver, session, transaction.
Then we have `query` for querying, `logic` for reasoning, and `concept` for the API to be able to process concepts in
responses.

.How to build this diagram from the source code
[%collapsible]
====
1. Clone the TypeDB Driver https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver[repository,window=_blank].
2. Ensure https://bazel.build/start[Bazel] is installed.
3. Use the following command to gather info on call dependencies:
+
[,bash]
----
bazel query --noimplicit_deps 'allpaths(//:driver-java,//common:common)' --output graph > graph.in
----
4. Visualize the gathered information:
+
[,bash]
----
dot -Tpng < graph.in > graph.png

There are many places we could start building a driver. In the
xref:typedb::tutorials/new-driver-tutorial.adoc[] tutorial, we start by
attempting to make a single gRPC call to TypeDB, and create a database.

=== Connection and databases

To instantiate a driver we need to be able to establish a network connection to a TypeDB Core server or a
TypeDB Enterprise cluster.

This connection opens us basic features of xref:typedb::development/connect.adoc#_databases[database] management, user
management (TypeDB Enterprise & TypeDB Cloud only) and enables us to open a session.

[#_grpc]
==== gRPC

https://grpc.io/[gRPC,window=_blank] is the network call framework that TypeDB uses. A TypeDB Driver needs a gRPC driver
library to communicate with the server. Most languages have gRPC libraries.

Architecturally, gRPC is an alternative to HTTP (say, REST API or websockets). In TypeDB's client-server architecture,
performance is critical, and gRPC fits well with TypeDB's scaling model. It establishes a long-lasting connection,
much like a websocket. Payloads are encoded in the Protocol Buffer format, which is both efficient and strongly typed:

[,protobuf]
----
// Example message from typedb-protocol: note that each field has a restricted data type (string, int64 etc.)
message Attribute {
  message Value {
    oneof value {
      string string = 1;
      bool boolean = 2;
      int64 long = 3;
      double double = 4;
      // time since epoch in milliseconds
      int64 date_time = 5;
    }
  }
}
----

==== TypeDB protocol

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers[Protocol Buffers,window=_blank] is the encoding used to serialise
network messages.
Proto definition files can be compiled into server-side and client-side libraries using a Protobuf Compiler.
In our case, we only need client-side library compilation. Most languages have Protobuf compilers available.

TypeDB's protobuf definitions can be found in the
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[GitHub repository,window=_blank].
During development, it's sufficient to manually copy-paste from this repository and do a one-time compilation.
A more reliable method is to import the Protocol repo via a package manager and compile it at build time.
TypeDB's build system, https://bazel.build/[Bazel,window=_blank], offers one approach.

If there will be a need to use a different package manager, the TypeDB team may also be able to help by setting up
a distribution channel for the chosen language's compiled protobuf files. If this is the case, please get in touch.

=== Session and transaction

To query schema and data, we need to open a Session and Transaction of the appropriate types. For example, we can't
modify schema in a data session.

A Session is essentially a long-lasting tunnel from a driver to a database. However, we implement that with just simple
RPC calls -- Open and Close.

Sessions consume server resources, and may hold locks. If a driver disconnects (say, by crashing) the server needs a
way to know. So, we use a pulse mechanism. Every 5 seconds, a TypeDB driver sends a Session Pulse to inform the
server that the driver is still alive. If no pulse is received in 30 seconds, the server times out the session,
freeing up its resources for use elsewhere.

Once a Session is open, we can open a Transaction inside it to read and write to the database. This is implemented
with a bidirectional streaming RPC. Rather like a websocket, it's a long-lasting tunnel that allows the driver and
server to talk to each other.

TypeDB Drivers support multiple layers of concurrency. A Client can have many Sessions, and a Session can have many
Transactions, and a Transaction can perform many Queries.

image::concurrency-model.png[Concurrency Model]

=== Inside a transaction stream

Inside a transaction stream, the driver sends requests, and the server is expected to respond to the driver's
requests in a timely manner.

Each request must have the same message type. This is `Transaction.Client`, defined in
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol/blob/master/common/transaction.proto[typedb-protocol,window=_blank]:

[,protobuf]
----
// typedb-protocol/common/transaction.proto
message Transaction {

  message Client {
    repeated Req reqs = 1;
  }

  message Req {
    bytes req_id = 1;
    map&lt;string, string&gt; metadata = 2;
    oneof req {
      Open.Req open_req = 3;
      Stream.Req stream_req = 4;
      Commit.Req commit_req = 5;
      Rollback.Req rollback_req = 6;
      QueryManager.Req query_manager_req = 7;
      ConceptManager.Req concept_manager_req = 8;
      LogicManager.Req logic_manager_req = 9;
      Rule.Req rule_req = 10;
      typedb.protocol.Type.Req type_req = 11;
      Thing.Req thing_req = 12;
    }
  }
}
----

Each *request message* is suffixed with `.Req`, and has a matching `.Res` (or `.ResPart`) to represent the server's
response to that message.

Now, there are two basic patterns to the communications; _single_ responses and _streamed_ responses, both of which
are illustrated below.

image::response-structure.png[Streamed or single responses]

Here, `Define.Req` and `Match.Req` are both types of `QueryManager.Req`, and `Type.Create.Req` and `GetThing.Req` are
types of `ConceptManager.Req`.

==== Handling streamed responses

For requests such as TypeQL Match queries, the responses can be very long, so TypeDB breaks them up into parts.
We issue `Match.Req`, and get back multiple ``Match.ResPart``s, which each contain some answers to the query.

Getting all the answers may be costly in terms of server resources, and it can be wasteful if the driver exits early.
So we only auto-stream up to a certain limit, called the *prefetch size*, then we send a special message called
"`Continue`".
If the driver needs more answers, it should respond with a `Stream.Req`.
That tells the server to continue streaming, and, when there are no answers left, it sends a `Stream.ResPart`
with `state = DONE`.

In a driver, the Match response is typically represented as a Stream or Iterator. Seeing "`DONE`" from the server
signals the end of iteration. The iterator implementation varies a bit by language. In Java, Streams are in-built;
in Python we use an Iterator, and in NodeJS we use an Async Iterator. Use whatever is most natural in the preferred
language.

==== Handling concurrent requests

Concurrent queries create a slight complication, since all the responses go down the same gRPC stream. We handle them
by attaching a Request ID (`req_id`) to each request, and, whenever a Request is made, we create a Response
Collector -- essentially a bucket, or queue, that holds responses for this Query.

The queue fills up as answers are received from the server, and it gets emptied as the user iterates over these answers.

==== Request batching

Loading bulk data may potentially require millions of INSERT queries, and gRPC can only send so many in a given
timeframe. To mitigate this, we use request batching - see the `RequestTransmitter` class in any official driver.
It collects all requests in a 1ms time window, bundles them into a single gRPC message, and dispatches it.

=== Exploring query answers

See the xref:typedb::development/response.adoc[Response interpretation] page to find information of possible
response to different query types.

The `ConceptMap` objects returned by a xref:typedb::development/read.adoc#_get[Get query] can contain
any type of `Concept`. This `Concept` class hierarchy is reflected in a TypeDB Driver implementation and class
structure.

image::overview_hierarchy.png[Concept Hierarchy]

[WARNING]
====
The `thing`, `thingtype`, and `type` will be deprecated in one of the upcoming versions and deleted in TypeDB
version 3.0. Concepts hierarchy will be simplified for the Concept term to include Entity, Attribute, Relation,
EntityType, AttributeType, RelationType, and RoleType directly.
====

Implementing all concept methods for TypeDB API is not complicated, but it is quite long as there are a
lot of methods. Concept methods either return single or streamed responses. `ThingType.getInstances` is an example
of a Streamed Concept method.

== TypeDB Enterprise driver

TypeDB Cloud and TypeDB Enterprise use groups of TypeDB Enterprise servers which communicate internally to form a
consensus when querying. If one server has an outage, we can recover from the issue by falling back to another server.
To enable this, TypeDB Driver constructs 1 Core driver per a TypeDB server (Enterprise server):

image::cluster.png[Cluster driver Architecture]

Suppose we open a Transaction to, say, Node 1, but we don't get a response.

In TypeDB, that would be a non-recoverable error. In TypeDB Enterprise & TypeDB Cloud, the Cluster driver simply
reroutes the request to a different Core driver, which sends the request to its linked server. In this way, the
driver recovers from the failure and continues running as normal.

[#_behavioral_testing]
== Behavioral testing

The recommended way to test a TypeDB Driver is by using the
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-behaviour[TypeDB Behaviour spec,window=_blank].
It's written in a language-agnostic syntax named https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/[Gherkin,window=_blank].
Tests consist of named steps. To run the tests in a new driver, we just need to implement the steps.
This means we can test our driver without having to write a single test!

[,gherkin]
----
# To run the test, implement each step: e.g.,"connection create database: {name}"
Scenario: commit in a read transaction throws
    When connection create database: typedb
    Given connection open schema session for database: typedb
    When session opens transaction of type: read
    Then transaction commits; throws exception
----

== Conclusion

A Driver is considered production-ready once it passes all the <<_behavioral_testing,tests>> and adheres to the
TypeDB architecture.
