:summary: How to connect to a TypeDB Cloud deployment.
:experimental:

TypeDB Cloud deployment is a cluster of TypeDB Enterprise servers.
As such, it can receive connections from xref:clients::clients.adoc[TypeDB Clients]:

* TypeDB Studio
* TypeDB Console
* TypeDB Drivers:
** Java
** Python
** Node.js

To connect to a TypeDB Cloud deployment, we need the following information:

* *Address* of at least one server in the deployment:
** IP or domain name -- generated for every server in a deployment by TypeDB Cloud.
** Port number that the server is configured to listen to -- by default, it's `1729`.
* *Credentials* of any user to authenticate on the server:
** Username -- by default, it's `admin`.
** Password -- by default, it's `password`.

To get the *address* of the server in a deployment, use the following steps:

* Open the xref:deployments/management.adoc#_details[deployment details] page.
* Find the `Address` column in the table in the `Machines` section.

[NOTE]
====
Ideally, we want to use all servers of the deployments cluster to connect to with a TypeDB Client.

But if we set the address for only one server, TypeDB Client will get information on all servers in the
cluster upon connection.
====

Connection to a TypeDB Enterprise server requires valid *credentials* of a user existing on that server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The user to connect to a TypeDB server/cluster is not the same user as a user on the TypeDB Cloud web portal.
====

include::cloud::quickstart.adoc[tag=default-credentials]

We can configure users on in a TypeDB Enterprise server/cluster with TypeDB Console or with Driver API methods
for xref:clients::java/java-api-ref.adoc#_users[Java],
xref:clients::python/python-api-ref.adoc#_users[Python], and
xref:clients::nodejs/node-js-api-ref.adoc#_users[Node.js].

TypeDB Studio::

--
We can use the xref:clients::studio.adoc#_connect_to_typedb_server[basic connection guide] to connect to a TypeDB Cloud
deployment with TypeDB Studio, but we need to select the *TypeDB Cluster* option in the drop-down menu at the
*Connect to TypeDB* window.
That will display additional options to set addresses for multiple servers in a cluster, username, password,
and TLS encryption switch.

Use the btn:[Manage cluster addresses] button to set the address of a server to connect.

image::studio-manage-cluster-address.png[Connect to Studio window, width = 70%, link=self]

Insert the TypeDB Cloud deployment server address (including the port number, for example, `127.0.0.1:1729` or rather
`a242676f5710e462e9eed7a78d795ecb-1969767772.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:1729`) to the text field and press
the btn:[Add] button.

pages.

==  What to do next?

Upon successful connection to a server in a TypeDB Cloud deployment, we can use the TypeDB Client we have used
to send some xref:typedb::fundamentals/queries.adoc[queries] to the server.

For example, complete our xref:typedb::quickstart-guide.adoc[] with TypeDB Cloud deployment.

For more information, see the following:

* xref:typedb::overview.adoc[TypeDB documentation] for a general understanding of how to use TypeDB server,
* xref:clients::clients.adoc[TypeDB Clients documentation] for information on how to use Driver API methods,
TypeDB Studio GUI, or TypeDB Console CLI,
* xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL documentation] for an advanced understanding of building a query and using patterns.
