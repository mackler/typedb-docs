All queries to a TypeDB database are written in TypeQL.

TypeQL is a *declarative* query language. For more information, see the xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL] section.

A top-level TypeQL construct is a query.

TypeQL query consists of clauses (one, two, or three).

A clause always starts with a keyword that defines the type of clause.

[#_define_query]
== Define query

A Define query is used to define types and rules in a database schema.

A Define query consists of a single `define` clause.

For more information on the Define query, see the
xref:typeql::schema/define-types.adoc#_define_query[Define types] and
xref:typeql::schema/define-rules.adoc[] pages.

For examples of how to perform a Define query, see the xref:typedb::development/schema.adoc[] page.

[#_define_clause]
=== Define clause

A `define` clause adds the concepts and the constraints, described by its pattern, to the schema of the current
database.

A `define` clause is used only in the Define query.

A `define` clause has the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
define <pattern>
----

A pattern used in the `define` clause is limited to xref:typeql::schema/define-types.adoc[defining types] and
xref:typeql::schema/define-rules.adoc[rules]: the DDL part of the TypeQL.

[#_undefine_query]
== Undefine query

An `undefine` clause removes the concepts, the constraints, and the rules described by its pattern, from the schema
of the current database.

An Undefine query consists of a single `undefine` clause.

For more information on the Undefine query, see the
xref:typeql::schema/modify.adoc#_undefine_a_type[Modify existing schema] page.

For examples of how to perform an Undefine query, see the
xref:typedb::development/schema.adoc#_undefine[Defining schema] page.

[#_undefine_clause]
=== Undefine clause

An `undefine` clause is used only in the Undefine query.

An `undefine` clause has the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
undefine <pattern>
----

A pattern used in the `undefine` clause is xref:typeql::schema/modify.adoc[limited] to the DDL part of the TypeQL.

[#_insert_query]
== Insert query

An Insert query is used to add data to the TypeDB database.

An Insert query consists of an *optional* `match` clause and an `insert` clause.

The optional xref:typedb::fundamentals/queries.adoc#_match[`match`] clause uses a
xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc#_patterns_overview[pattern]
to find existing data which is needed as a context to insert new data. If no context is required (no existing data
to link with the inserted data) -- there is no need for a `match` clause in this query.

The xref:typedb::fundamentals/queries.adoc#_insert[`insert`] clause uses a pattern to specify the data to be inserted
and may include references to the existing data found by the optional `match` clause.

For example, to insert a new relation instance, we need to match every instance that will play a role in it to be
able to address them in the `insert` clause.

An Insert query returns a stream of inserted concepts (with any number of results: from zero to many).

The `insert` clause will be executed exactly once for every matched pattern found by the `match` clause. If the `match`
clause is omitted the `insert` query will be executed exactly once.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If there are no matches for a `match` clause in an `insert` query, then there will be no inserts.
====

The `insert` clause can have a pattern with multiple statements to insert in one query. But it can't insert types
(use xref:typedb::development/schema.adoc#_define_types[define] to insert new types) and can't have the following:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Negation
- `is` keyword

For more information on the Insert query, see the xref:typeql::data/insert.adoc[] page in the
xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL] documentation.

For examples of how to perform an Insert query, see the xref:typedb::development/write.adoc#_insert[Insert query] section of the
xref:typedb::development/write.adoc[] page.

[#_match]
=== Match clause

A `match` clause is one of the most important.
It’s used to find data and types that match a particular pattern in a TypeDB database.
The matched data is later used in the consequent clause of the same query.

Matching data with a `match` clause is mandatory in all data query types, except the <<_insert_query,Insert query>>:

//* <<_insert_query,Insert query>> (the `match` clause is optional)
* <<_delete_query,Delete query>>
* <<_update_query,Update query>>
* <<_fetch_query,Fetch query>>
* <<_get_query,Get query>>

A `match` clause has the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
match <pattern>
----

For more information on patterns, see the xref:typeql::data/basic-patterns.adoc[] page.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $f;
----

A pattern used in a `match` clause can address both types and data instances.
See the xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc[] page for more information.

[#_insert]
=== Insert clause

An `insert` clause is used to add new data to a database.

If the inserted data is somehow connected to the data existing in the database, we need to use the `match` clause
before the `insert` clause in the same Insert query.

An `insert` clause has the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
insert <pattern>
----

.Insert clause example
[,typeql]
----
insert $p isa person, has email "email@vaticle.com";
----

The above insert query doesn't require a `match` clause, because it binds the only variable it has to a `person` type.
It creates a new instance of the `person` type in a database, before inserting an ownership of the email for the
person.

A pattern used in an `insert` clause can use the variables from the preceding `match` clause.
See the xref:typeql::data/insert.adoc[] page for more information.

[#_delete_query]
== Delete query

A Delete query is used to remove data from the TypeDB database.

A Delete query consists of a `match` clause and a `delete` clause.

A `match` clause uses a xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc#_patterns_overview[pattern] to find existing
data/references which may be removed. To delete existing data, we need to find it first.

A `delete` clause uses a pattern to specify precisely the data to be removed.

For example, to remove ownership of an attribute without deleting the attribute itself.
Or, to remove the player of a role from a relation without deleting either the player or the relation/role.

The deletion pattern is executed exactly once for every result matched by the `match` clause.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If there are no matches for a `match` clause in a `delete` query, then there will be no deletes.
====

The `delete` clause can have a pattern with multiple statements to delete in one query. But it can't delete types (use
xref:typedb::development/schema.adoc#_undefine_types[undefine] to delete types) and can't have the following:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Negation
- `is` keyword

For more information on the Delete query, see the xref:typeql::data/delete.adoc[Delete] page in the
xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL] documentation.

For examples of how to perform a Delete query, see the xref:typedb::development/write.adoc#_delete_query[Delete query] section of the
xref:typedb::development/write.adoc[] page.

=== Match clause

See the <<_match>> section above.

[#_delete]
=== Delete clause

A `delete` clause is used to delete data from a database.

A `delete` clause has the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
delete <pattern>
----

.See the delete clause example
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
delete $p has email $e;
----
====

A pattern used in a `delete` clause must use the variables from the preceding `match` clause.
See the xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc[Patterns] page for more information.

[#_update_query]
== Update query

An Update query removes data from the TypeDB database and then inserts new data instead.

An Update query consists of a `match` clause, a `delete` clause, and an `insert` clause.

A `match` clause uses xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc[patterns] to find existing data/references to be changed.
To delete existing data, we need to find it first.

A `delete` clause is used to precisely select what to delete with a pattern. The deletion pattern is executed exactly
once for every result matched by the `match` clause.

An `insert` clause is used to insert new data after the deletion of the old one. The insertion pattern is executed
exactly once for every result matched by the `match` clause.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If there are no matches for a `match` clause in an update (`match-delete-insert`) query, then there will be no
deletes and no inserts.
====

The `delete` clause can have a pattern with multiple statements to delete in one query. But it can't delete types (use
xref:typedb::fundamentals/queries.adoc#_undefine_query[undefine] to delete types) and can't have the following:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Negation
- `is` keyword

The `insert` clause can have a pattern with multiple statements to insert in one query. But it can't insert types (use
xref:typedb::fundamentals/queries.adoc#_define_query[define] to insert new types) and can't have the following:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Negation
- `is` keyword

Unlike other databases, TypeDB does not update data in place. Data is updated by replacing references to it.
When we remove a player from a role in a relation, the player itself is not removed from the database, but rather the
information of it playing the role.

In addition, attributes are immutable. Rather than changing the value of an owned attribute,
the ownership of it is replaced with the ownership of a new/different attribute.

For more information on the Update query, see the xref:typeql::data/update.adoc[] page.

.See the update query example
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has full-name $n;
  $n contains "inappropriate word";
delete
  $p has $n;
insert
  $p has full-name "deleted";
----

For every instance of `person` entity type with owned attribute of `full-name` type, which value contains
`inappropriate word` string, we delete the ownership of the attribute and insert an ownership of a new one with the
value of `deleted` to the same entity.
====

For more examples of how to perform an Update query, see the
xref:typedb::development/write.adoc#_update_query[Update query]
section of the xref:typedb::development/write.adoc[] page.

[#_fetch_query]
== Fetch query

A Fetch query retrieves values from a TypeDB database and returns them as JSON strings.

Fetch queries consist of a `match` clause and a `fetch` clause, followed by optional modifiers.

For more information on the Fetch query, see the xref:typeql::data/fetch.adoc[] page.

For examples of how to send a Fetch query, see the xref:typedb::development/read.adoc[] page.

=== Match clause

See the <<_match>> section above.

[#_fetch_clause]
=== Fetch clause

A `fetch` clause is used in a Fetch query
to specify a projection of values from matched data to an output of JSON strings.

This clause is executed exactly once for every result matched by the `match` clause of the same query.

For more information, see the xref:typeql::data/fetch.adoc#_fetch_clause[Fetch query] page.

[#_get_query]
== Get query

A Get query is used to retrieve data from a TypeDB database.

A Get query consists of a `match` clause and a `get` clause.

A Get query returns a stream of results.
The number of query results returned is equal to the number of solutions matched by a `match` clause.
Every returned result is a ConceptMap if no aggregation nor grouping is used.

For more information on Get queries, see the xref:typeql::data/get.adoc[] page.

For examples of how to send a Get query, see the xref:typedb::development/read.adoc[] page.

=== Match clause

See the <<_match>> section above.

[#_get_clause]
=== Get clause

A `get` clause is used in a Get query
to filter matched concepts from a `match` clause to be retrieved in a Get query.

This clause is executed exactly once for every matched result from a `match` clause of the same query.
A `get` clause produces a ConceptMap for every matched result unless used with a modifier.
A ConceptMap maps every variable from a `get` clause with a particular concept from a TypeDB database,
accessible via Driver API methods.

The syntax for a `get` clause is as follows:

.Get clause syntax
[,typeql]
----
[get <variable> [(, <variable>)...];]
[modifiers]
----

.Get clause example
[,typeql]
----
get $p, $f;
----

The variable or variables mentioned in a `get` clause must be bound (set) in the `match` clause of the same query.

A Get query with a `get` clause returns its results filtered -- only variables mentioned in the `get` clause are
returned.
Every result has a concept or a value for every variable mentioned in the `get` clause.
If no variables mentioned in a `get` clause,
then all variables from the `match` clause of the same query are used implicitly.

[#_modifiers]
==== Modifiers

Optionally, a `get` clause can have modifiers added after the list of variables.

Those modifiers can drastically change the output of the Get query:

* xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_sort_the_answers[sort] -- sorting the results by a variable;
* xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_offset_the_answers[offset] + xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_limit_the_results[limit] --
  used for pagination of results;
* xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_group[group] -- grouping results by a variable;
* xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_aggregation[aggregation] -- process the results to produce a value for an answer.
// count | sum,max,min,mean,median,std <var>
