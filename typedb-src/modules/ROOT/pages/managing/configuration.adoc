//:stem:

There are two ways to configure TypeDB:

* <<_command_line_arguments,command line arguments>>,
* and <<_configuration_file,configuration file>>.

[#_command_line_arguments]
== Command line arguments

Use command line arguments with the command `typedb server` to configure the server upon its launch. The command line
arguments will override any relevant settings from the config file.

All arguments must:

* start with the double dash prefix `--`,
* be separated from their value (if any) by:
** equals sign (`=`),
** or whitespace.

Some arguments are exclusive to the command line interface:

* `--help`: print out the help menu and exit.
* `--version`: print out the version of the server and exit.
* `--config /path/to/external/typedb-config.yml`: use the specified configuration file.

Additional arguments are derived from the configuration `.yaml` file. Any value from the configuration file
can be overridden by a command line argument, as shown in the <<_configuration_file_options_via_command_line_arguments>>
section.

=== Getting help

For all available commands via the command line use the `--help` argument to get a reference:

[,bash]
----
typedb server --help
----

This will list out how to use specific command line arguments as well as options derived from the configuration file.

[#_configuration_file]
== Configuration file

TypeDB accepts a configuration (or config) file with a specific YAML format. See the
<<_sample_configuration,sample configuration>> below.

This file usually has four top level sections:

* <<_server,`server`>>
* <<_storage_configuration,`storage`>>
* <<_log,`log`>>
* `vaticle-factory`

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any change in the configuration file to take effect, restart the TypeDB server.
====

[#_the_default_location_of_the_config_file]
=== Config file location

TypeDB ships with a default configuration file. The location of this file varies based on how TypeDB has been installed.

If downloaded manually, find the configuration file in the `server/conf` directory inside the unzipped folder.

If installed using Homebrew, check the following directory (replace the `+{version-number}+` placeholder with the exact
version installed):

----
/usr/local/Cellar/typedb/{version-number}/libexec/server/conf/config.yml
----

If installed using APT:

----
/opt/typedb/core/server/conf/config.yml
----

[#_sample_configuration]
=== Sample configuration

Here is a sample configuration file for TypeDB:

[,yaml]
----
server:
  address: 0.0.0.0:1729

storage:
  data: server/data
  database-cache:
    # configure storage-layer data and index cache per database
    # for large datasets, it is more important to have a large index cache than a large data cache
    data: 500mb
    index: 500mb

log:
  output:
    stdout:
      type: stdout
    file:
      type: file
      base-dir: server/logs
      file-size-limit: 50mb
      archive-grouping: month
      archive-age-limit: 1 year
      archives-size-limit: 1gb

  logger:
    default:
      level: warn
      output: [ stdout, file ]
    typedb:
      filter: com.vaticle.typedb.core
      level: info
      output: [ stdout, file ]
    storage:
      filter: com.vaticle.typedb.core.database
      level: info # on 'debug' the server will periodically log database storage properties
      output: [ stdout, file ]
  debugger:
    reasoner-tracer:
      enable: false
      type: reasoner-tracer
      output: file
    reasoner-perf-counters:
      enable: false
      type: reasoner-perf-counters

diagnostics:
  reporting:
    enable: true

vaticle-factory:
  enable: false
----

[#_server]
=== Server

The `server` section of the configuration file contains network and RPC options.

* `address`: the address to listen for TypeDB Clients connections via `gRPC`.
+
Use the `0.0.0.0` IP address to listen to all connections and `localhost` for connections from the local machine.

[#_storage_configuration]
=== Storage

The `storage` section of the configuration file contains the storage layer options.

* `data`: the location to write user data to. Defaults to within the server distribution under server/data.
* `database-cache`: *per-database* configuration for storage-level caching
** `data`: cache for often-used data.
** `index`: cache for data indexes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For production use, it is recommended that the `server.data` is set to a path outside of the `$TYPEDB_HOME`
(directory with TypeDB server files). This helps to make the process of upgrading TypeDB easier.
====

If the index cache is too small relative to the dataset, we may find severely degraded performance. We recommend
allocating at least *2%* of a database size equivalent to the index cache. For example, with *100 GB* of
on-disk data in a database, allocate at least *2 GB* of index cache. Allocating more can improve performance.

Additionally, we recommend the sum of data and index caches equal to about *20%* of the total memory of the server.

[#_log]
=== Log

The `log` section of the configuration file contains the logging options.

There are three subsections:

* <<_output,`output`>>
* <<_logger,`logger`>>
* <<_debugger,`debugger`>>

[#_output]
==== Output

`output` subsection defines destinations to write logs to.

* User-defined output channel name

** `type` -- it's either `file` or `stdout`.
** `base-dir` (`directory` prior to version `2.21.0`) -- filepath, relative to the server binary.
   Only available for `type: file`.
** `file-size-limit` (`file-size-cap` prior to version `2.21.0`)  -- maximum size of a log file.
   If the log file reaches the limit, a new file in the same directory
   will be started. This is similar to the `maxsize` config option in logrotate. Only available for `type: file`.
** `archive-grouping` -- configures the rollover and naming policy of archives produced by the logger. +
   Possible value variants are as follows:

*** `minute` or `minutes`
//yyyyMMdd-HHmm - internal filename format of a log archive
*** `hour` or `hours`
*** `day` or `days`
*** `week` or `weeks`
//yyyy-ww
*** `month` or `months`
*** `year` or `years`

// Filename template:
// typedb + fileDateFormat(outputType.archiveGrouping()) + .0.log.gz
// For example, `typedb_202306.0.log.gz`.

** `archive-age-limit` -- configures how long archive files are kept. +
   Old archives are only deleted when new ones are produced. +
   If the value is set to *zero*, then the age is unlimited (old logs are not deleted).
   Otherwise, the value should be a *positive integer*, followed by a whitespace and one of the following values for
   units:

*** `minute` or `minutes`
*** `hour` or `hours`
*** `day` or `days`
*** `week` or `weeks`
*** `month` or `months`
*** `year` or `years`

** `archives-size-limit` (`archives-size-cap` prior to version `2.21.0`) --
   maximum size of all log files. If the total size of all log files in the directory reaches
   the limit, the oldest one gets removed. Only available for `type: file`. +
   If the value is set to *zero*, then the total size is unlimited (older logs are not deleted to preserve total size
   limitation of the log archives).
   Otherwise, the value should be a *positive integer*, followed by one of the following values for units:

*** `kb`
*** `mb`
*** `gb`

[#_logger]
==== Logger

`logger` subsection configures logging for modules in TypeDB, along with a log level and output targets
(referencing outputs by name defined under the outputs section).

////
* `filter` -- a filter by TypeDB component. Possible values include the following:
** `com.vaticle.typedb.core`
** `com.vaticle.typedb.core.database`
** `com.vaticle.typedb.core.reasoner.planner`
** `com.vaticle.typedb.core.reasoner.common.ReasonerPerfCounters`
////
* `output` -- destination of the log output. Input format is a list of output channels, each of which must be defined
  in the <<_output,output>> subsection.

* `level` -- verbosity level. +
  One of the following values can be used:

** `warn`
** `info`
** `debug`

[NOTE]
====
On `debug` level the server will periodically log database storage properties.
====

//#todo Add documentation on verbosity levels differences

[#_debugger]
==== Debugger

`debugger` subsection configures TypeDB-specific debuggers.

Possible values for the `type` field are the following:

* `reasoner-tracer`
* `reasoner-perf-counters`

////

=== Diagnostics

TypeDB optionally reports anonymous diagnostics to guide the development and optimisation of TypeDB.
This data includes unexpected errors and occasional system status updates for number and size of databases,
and number of transactions executed per hour.

To disable error and diagnostic reporting set the `diagnostics.reporting.enabled` to `false` in the config file:

[,yaml]
----
diagnostics:
  reporting:
    enable: false
----

[#_configuration_file_options_via_command_line_arguments]
== Command line arguments

Use command line arguments to override any option in the configuration file.

For example, the configuration file sets the server address as the following:

[,yaml]
----
server:
  address: 0.0.0.0:1729
----

If we want to use port `1730` instead of `1729`, we can either update the configuration file or override it from the
command line using the following command:

[,bash]
----
typedb server --server.address 0.0.0.0:1730
----

Use the same approach to set a completely new section of the configuration that isn't present in the file yet. For
example, to define a new logger subsection to print out all query plans, we could do the following to set the package
`com.vaticle.typedb.core.traversal` to output on a more verbose level:

[,bash]
----
typedb server  \
  --server.address 0.0.0.0:1730  \
  --log.logger.traversal.filter com.vaticle.typedb.core.traversal  \
  --log.logger.traversal.level debug \
  --log.logger.traversal.output "[ file, stdout ]"
----

== TypeDB Cloud cluster configuration

Every server in a cluster has its own config file that contains a list of known servers in the cluster. A server in a
cluster will not accept connections from servers that are not on the list.

[NOTE]
====
Changes to the server configuration require a server restart to take effect.
====

////
#todo Validate with engineers

### Add or remove cluster's servers

To add or remove a server to/from a cluster:

1. Stop all TypeDB servers in the cluster.
2. Update the configuration files of all (both new and old) TypeDB servers.
3. Start all TypeDB servers of the new cluster.

-
////

== Host machine requirements

The minimum host machine configuration for running a single TypeDB database is 4 (v)CPUs, 10 GB memory, with SSD.

The recommended starting configuration is 8 (v)CPUs, 16 GB memory, and SSD. Bulk loading is scaled effectively by
adding more CPU cores.

The following is the breakdown of TypeDB memory requirements:

* The JVM memory: is configurable when booting the server with `JAVAOPTS="-Xmx4g"` typedb server. This gives the JVM *4 GB*
of memory. Defaults to *25%* of system memory on most machines.
* Storage layer baseline consumption: approximately *2 GB*.
* Storage layer caches: this is about *2x* cache size per database. If the *data and index caches* sum up to *1 GB*,
the memory requirement is *2 GB* in working memory.
* Memory per CPU: approximately *0.5 GB* additional per (v)CPU under a full load.

We can estimate the amount of memory the server will need to run a single database with the following equation:

////
[stem]
++++
"required memory" = "JVM memory" + "2 GB" + (2 xx "configured db-caches in GB") + ("0.5 GB" xx "Number of CPUs")
++++
////

`required memory = JVM memory + 2 GB + (2 × configured db-caches in GB) + (0.5 GB × CPUs)`

For example, on a 4 CPU machine, with the default 1 GB of per-database storage caches, and the JVM using 4 GB of RAM,
the default requirement for memory would be: `4 GB + 2 GB + (2 × 1 GB) + (0.5 GB × 4)` = *10 GB*.

Each additional database will consume an additional amount at least equal to the cache requirements (in this example,
an additional 2 GB of memory for each database).

=== Open file limit

To support large data volumes, it is important to check the open file limit the operating system imposes. Some Unix
distributions default to `1024` open file descriptors. This can be checked with the following command:

[,bash]
----
ulimit -n
----

We recommend this is increased to at least `50 000`.
