TypeDB Studio is an IDE specifically designed for TypeDB databases and
querying with xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc[TypeQL]. +
See all released versions on https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-studio/releases[GitHub,window=_blank].

For information on how to install and run TypeDB Studio, see the xref:home::install.adoc#_studio[Install and Run] page.

== Features

TypeDB Studio has a unique set of functions and abilities to help with development using TypeDB:

* Graphical user interface for connecting to TypeDB without the use of command line tools, libraries, or the driver API.
* Database manager to create and delete databases.
* Type browser for exploring type hierarchy of a database's schema.
* Type editor for adjusting existing types in a database.
* Project file management to store your favorite queries.
* Convenient multi-tab query editor with TypeQL syntax highlighting, auto-saving, query execution, response output,
and pop-up notifications for warnings and error messages that may occur during runtime/query execution.
* Graph visualization engine for visualizing query results using user-modifiable, force-directed graph drawings.
* Local syntax validation before sending instructions and queries to the server.
* Automatic transaction management with full GUI control, including read/write transactions, schema/data sessions,
as well as transaction control (commit/rollback/close) and transaction options.
* Rule-based inference enabled with a click of a button (Infer).
* Explanations visualization displays the deductive reasoning behind inferred data for root cause analysis.

== Prepare for work

To prepare TypeDB Studio for work, you need to complete the following steps:

. <<_select_a_project_directory,Select a project directory>> to save your queries locally.
. <<_connect_to_typedb,Connect>> to a TypeDB Cloud cluster or a TypeDB Core server.
. <<_select_database,Select a database>> to work with.

[#_select_a_project_directory]
=== Select a project directory

To save queries, TypeDB Studio stores them as files in a local directory, called project directory.
To select a project directory,
click on the open folder icon (image:home::studio-icons/project.png[]) in the top toolbar.

[#_connect_to_typedb]
=== Connect to TypeDB

Click btn:[Connect to TypeDB] on the right side of the top toolbar,
select TypeDB edition below, and follow the instructions:

include::home::quickstart.adoc[tags=connect_studio]

[#_select_database]
=== Select a database

If there are no databases yet, <<_create_a_database,create>> a new one.
Select a database to work with the dropdown menu on the right from the database icon
(image:home::studio-icons/database.png[])
in the top toolbar.

[NOTE]
====
If the dropdown menu is greyed out and unresponsive, then check your <<_connect_to_typedb,connection>> to TypeDB.
====

== Basic operations

=== Connection

Connection management is performed from the Connect to TypeDB window.
To open the window, click the btn:[Connect to TypeDB] on the right side of the top toolbar.
When connected, the button changes its label to repeat the address of the server connected to.

Inside the Connect to TypeDB window, you can see connection settings and status (bottom left corner).
Pay attention to the first line with a drop-down, as selecting TypeDB Cloud shows additional connection settings.

To disconnect from TypeDB, click the btn:[Disconnect] button in the Connect to TypeDB window.

=== Databases

==== Select

TypeDB Studio lets us query one database at a time.
To select a database to work with, use the dropdown menu on the right from the database icon
(image:home::studio-icons/database.png[])
in the top toolbar.

[#_create_a_database]
==== Create

To create a new database, make sure TypeDB Studio is connected to TypeDB and follow the steps:

. Open the btn:[Manage Databases] window by clicking on the database button (image:home::studio-icons/database.png[]) in the top toolbar.
. Enter the name for the new database and hit btn:[Create].

image::drivers::studio/databases-interface-iam-database.png[Database Manager with IAM database, 300, link=self]

==== Delete

To delete a database:

. Open the btn:[Manage Databases] window by clicking on the database button (image:home::studio-icons/database.png[]) in the top toolbar.
. Select a database to delete from a list of databases and click the Delete button on the right.
. Confirm deletion by typing in the name of the databsae to delete and then clicking the btn:[Delete] button.

=== Files

All file management is done via the Project panel that shows files in a given project directory.
You can perform file operations within the Project panel with a context menu opened by a right click of a mouse.

All files open in a tab of the text editor on the right from the Project panel.
New files are created by the Project panel's context menu
or by clicking the plus icon (`+`) in the tabs panel of the text editor.
They are assigned a filename of `Untitled<x>.tql` by default, where `<x>` is an autoincremented number.
These Untitled files are stored in a hidden folder inside your project directory.
You can rename them and choose a different location for their storage by saving them.

=== Query design

One of the most important functions of TypeDB Studio is
to provide an environment to design and debug queries written in TypeQL.
Use the *Text editor* panel in the middle to do that.
It has a built-in TypeQL syntax highlighting.

Use a contextual menu to adjust font size or run a selected fragment of TypeQL.

For debugging with TypeDB Studio, see the
<<_query_execution,query execution>>,
<<_results,response output>>, and
<<_transaction_control,transaction management>> below.

[#_query_execution]
=== Query execution

Make sure TypeDB Studio is <<_connect_to_typedb,connected>> to TypeDB,
a database is <<_select_database,selected>>, and the query you want to run is open in a tab of the Text ediotr panel.

Select a session type (image:home::studio-icons/session-data.png[])
and a transaction type (image:home::studio-icons/transaction-write.png[]) in the top Toolbar.

To run a query from a tab of the Text editor panel,
use the run query button (image:home::studio-icons/run.png[]) from the
<<_transaction_control, transaction controls>> in the top Toolbar.

For the `write` transaction type wait for the query to complete its execution
and select one of the transaction control actions:
Commit (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[]),
Close (image:home::studio-icons/close.png[]), etc.

If any error occurs during a query validation or transaction, it is shown as a red popup in the bottom right corner of
the TypeDB Studio window.
If a `write` transaction committed successfully -- a blue pop-up with a transaction confirmation is displayed.
See example below.

image::drivers::studio/project-schema-committed.png[Commit the Transaction, width = 70%, link=self]

For more information on different control elements for query execution, see the <<_transaction_control>> section below.

[#_results]
==== How to see results

Under the *Text editor* panel there is the *Run* panel.
The Run panel is collapsed by default if no query has been run yet.

This panel has 2 sets of tabs:

* Tabs at the top of the *Run* panel are for different query attempts.
+
We can pin a tab there to save it for later.
Otherwise, it will be rewritten with the next run.

* Tabs at the bottom of the *Run* panel are for different results.
These include the mandatory `Log` tab with a direct textual output and `Graph` tabs
(one per every query in the active *Text editor* tab being run) with a graph visualization of response.

The `Log` tab output includes errors and query execution messages.

[#_transaction_control]
=== Transaction controls

To control query execution, we have the top *Toolbar* elements located to the right from the database selection
drop-down menu. See below.

image::drivers::studio/studio-transaction-controls.png[Transaction controls, link=self]

From left to right (numbered respectively to the screenshot numbers):

. xref:connecting/overview.adoc#_sessions[Session] type switch (image:home::studio-icons/session-data.png[])
. xref:connecting/overview.adoc#_transactions[Transaction] type switch (image:home::studio-icons/transaction-write.png[])
. btn:[snapshot] button -- enables snapshot feature that encapsulates a transaction in a snapshot of a database's data
until the transaction is committed or closed.
Write transactions are always snapshoted.
May be enabled or disabled for read transactions.
. btn:[infer] button -- enable xref:developing/infer.adoc[inferring data] by rules.
Only available for read transactions.
. btn:[explain] button -- enable xref:developing/infer.adoc#_explain_query[explanations] mechanics.
Only available for read transactions with *snapshot* and *infer* enabled.
. btn:[Transaction status] (image:home::studio-icons/activity.png[]) indicator -- transaction activity indicator. Green if there is a
transaction opened by TypeDB Studio at this moment. Gray if there is no opened transaction. Rotating animation --
TypeDB Studio processing the query or the results (including additional API calls).
. btn:[Close transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/close.png[]) button -- close active transaction without committing the results.
. btn:[Rollback transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/revert.png[]) button -- revert the transaction results without closing it.
. btn:[Commit transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[]) button -- commit the changes and close the transaction.
. btn:[Run Query] (image:home::studio-icons/run.png[]) button -- run query or queries in the active tab of the *Text editor* panel.
It will open a transaction (with the session type and transaction type specified in the *Toolbar* on the left)
and execute the TypeQL code against the selected database.
. btn:[Stop Signal] (image:home::studio-icons/signal.png[]) button -- stop query execution after the next result.

[#_inference]
== Inference

To run a query with inference, simply switch the inference option *on* before executing a query.

The xref:basics/inference.adoc[inference] transaction option can be switched *on* and *off* with
the btn:[infer] button in the top *Toolbar*.

[NOTE]
====
If the btn:[infer] button is inactive, double-check the following prerequisites are met:

- there is an active database <<_connect_to_typedb,connection>>;
- there is a database <<_select_database,selected>>;
- the transaction type is set to *read*.
====

As a result of running a query with inference, we can get <<_results,results>> in the *Run* panel. If there are any
inferred instances of data they will be shown with green lining in the graph visualization. And inferred connections
(ownerships or roles played) will be shown as green arrows. See the example below.

[#_inference_results]
image::drivers::studio/inference.png[Inference results example, width = 70%, link=self]

[#_explanation]
=== Explanation

To run a query with explanation, simply switch the explanation option *on* before executing a query. To be able to do
 that, the inference and the snapshot options must also be enabled.

The xref:developing/infer.adoc#_explain_query[explanation] transaction option can be switched
*on* and *off* with the btn:[explain] button in the top *Toolbar*. The inference and snapshot options can be enabled
by the btn:[infer] and the btn:[snapshot] buttons respectively.

[NOTE]
====
If the btn:[explain] button is inactive, double-check the following:

- the btn:[infer] button is *on*;
- the btn:[snapshot] button is *on*;
- there is an active database <<_connect_to_typedb,connection>>;
- there is a database <<_select_database,selected>>;
- the transaction type is set to *read*.
====

As a result of running a query with inference and explanation options we can get <<_results,results>> in the
*Run* panel. If there are any inferred instances of data they will be shown with green lining in the graph
visualization. And inferred connections (ownerships or roles played) will be shown as green arrows. As it was shown
in the <<_inference_results,inference example>> above.

The only difference is -- double-clicking on any explainable inferred results will spawn an explanation. An explanation
is a set of additional instances and connections, that provide a direct explanation of the selected explainable inferred
result. See the example below.

[#_explanation_results]
image::drivers::studio/explanation.png[Explanation example, width = 70%, link=self]

[#_types_browser_capabilities]
== Type browser capabilities

Under the *Projects* panel that shows the project directory TypeDB has *Type Browser* panel that shows all types of
the schema of the current database.

[NOTE]
====
If the *Type Browser* panel is not displayed -- click the *Type Browser* vertical tab on the left edge of the
TypeDB Studio window.
====

All types are divided in three top level xref:typeql::fundamentals.adoc#_types[built-in types]:

* Attribute
* Entity
* Relation

In an empty database (without a schema) only these three built-in types shown in the panel.

In a database with a schema, all types displayed in the exact hierarchy they were created (subtypes inside their
supertypes). We can easily collapse or expand all the types in the structure tree by clicking the associated buttons
on the top of the *Type Browser* panel with double chevrons (arrow heads) pointing down or up respectively.

image::drivers::studio/type-browser.png[Type browser,width=300, link=self]

Double-clicking on any type will open the <<_type_editor,Type editor>> with information about the selected type
in a tab of the *Text editor*.

*Type Browser* panel can be closed by clicking the *X* icon in the top right corner of the panel. To reopen the panel
click the *Type Browser* tab on the left edge of the TypeDB Studio window.

=== Export schema

We can export schema of the database by clicking the btn:[Export Schema Types] button (second in row from left to
right) on the top of the *Type Browser* panel. It creates a new tab with inserted TypeQL code that creates the exact
schema that is in the current database.

[WARNING]
====
The btn:[Export Schema Types] button doesn't include rules into its output. That will be fixed in some of the next
versions of the TypeDB Studio.
====

[#_type_editor]
=== Type editor

By double-clicking any type, we can open the type editor window that shows all information about the selected type and
use the GUI to edit the type.

image::drivers::studio/type-editor.png[Type editor, width = 70%, link=self]

We can rename the type, change its supertype, abstract property, see all the connected types (subtypes, owned
attributes or owners of this particular attribute, related and played roles).

By clicking on one of the connected types we can see all information about it as well.

=== Rename a type

[WARNING]
====
For the renaming functions to be active set the session type switch to the `schema` and transaction type switch to the
`write` options first.
====

In TypeDB Studio we can rename a type in two ways:

* Open the type editor window by double-clicking on the type. At the very top click on the pencil icon immediately
right from the type name. Edit the name in the Label field and press btn:[Rename] button to finalize.
* Right-click on the type in the *Type browser* list. Click on the *Rename Type* option. Edit the name in the Label
field and press btn:[Rename] button to finalize.

[NOTE]
====
Renaming a type in any of this two ways will update the relevant type references in the schema and will not lead
to loosing existing data. All existing instances of the type will be available under the new types name.
====

=== Delete a type

[WARNING]
====
For the deleting functions to be active set the session type switch to the `schema` and transaction type switch to
the `write` options first.
====

In TypeDB Studio we can delete a type in two ways:

* Open the type editor window by double-clicking on the type. At the very bottom click on the btn:[Delete] button and
press btn:[Confirm] button. Commit the transaction with the green tick at the top of the Studio window.
* Right-click on the type in the *Type browser* list. Click on the Delete option and press btn:[Confirm] button. Commit
the transaction with the green tick at the top of the Studio window.

[NOTE]
====
In some cases, the btn:[Delete] option and button can be disabled. That means there are some conditions that prevent us
from deleting this type.

For example, we can't xref:developing/defining-schema.adoc#_undefine_subtype[delete a type that has a subtype].
====

== Settings

To configure TypeDB Studio, open the *Manage Preferences* window by clicking on the button with the gear (⚙) icon
in the top right corner of the TypeDB Studio window.
