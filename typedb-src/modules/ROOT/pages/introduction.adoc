== Summary

TypeDB:

* Is a strongly typed database that is unique in many ways:
 ** has its own special xref:fundamentals/types.adoc[static type system],
 ** uses xref:fundamentals/types.adoc#_root[Entity-Relationship model], extended with
xref:fundamentals/types.adoc#_attribute_types[Attributes] and xref:fundamentals/inference.adoc#_rules[Rules],
// - #todo add link to the types article
 ** supports subtyping and inheritance like OOP languages,
 ** uses declarative queries with its own query language: xref:typeql:ROOT:overview.adoc[TypeQL,window=_blank].
 We set the requirements for the result but do not specify how to achieve it.
* Is a transactional (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing[OLTP,window=_blank]) DBMS with
xref:development/connect.adoc#_acid_guarantees[ACID] guarantees.
* Has data separated by xref:development/connect.adoc#_databases[databases], each one with its own schema.

//== Thinking in TypeQL and TypeDB

// #todo Change the link to TypeQL -

The core of any TypeDB database is the representation of our business domain: the xref:development/schema.adoc#_schema[schema].
A schema is the blueprint of a TypeDB database. Using TypeQL, we define a schema to model a domain
true to nature:

* Types are defined to add context and constraints to data using strong typing with inheritance. All user-defined
  types in a schema are subtypes of other user-defined types or one of the following built-in root types:
** Entities. Representing self-sufficient objects.
** Relations. Representing n-ary relationships.
** Attributes. Representing properties with a value: numeric, text string, boolean, or date&time.
* Rules are defined to add a logical deduction to the schema. Any read queries with the inference option enabled can
  benefit from new attribute ownerships or relations that are deduced from data patterns. Those inferred
  concepts are transaction bound and are not persisted in a database.

// ** Context helps us to correctly model, classify and query our data the most logical way.
// ** Constraints are used for query validation and limiting the scope of queries.

== TypeDB description

TypeDB is a new kind of DBMS:

* not an SQL database, but uses an enhanced Entity-Relationship model, further extended by attributes as first-class
  citizens;
* not a graph database, but utilizes the power of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph[hypergraphs,window=_blank]
  without the need for developers to understand how it works to use it.

[NOTE]
====
Entity, Relation, and Attribute correspond to the components of an Entity-Relation-Attribute model, an
extension of the well-known https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model[ER model,window=_blank],
in which attributes (properties) are also treated as first-class citizens.

TypeDB guarantees data integrity and safety while enabling data-level inferences within the database.
A strong type system with subtyping and inheritance helps us break down complex problems into
meaningful and logical data models. TypeDB uses its own declarative query language, TypeQL, that gives powerful
abstraction over the implementation of storage to enable us to use complex data patterns and the reasoning engine.

With TypeQL, we describe data that we need by xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc#_patterns_overview[patterns]
consisting of constraints. TypeDB will use those patterns to retrieve all data that satisfies all the constraints
in the most efficient way. We don't have to think about query optimization, limitations of data storage
implementation, etc.

By combining TypeQL and TypeDB, we can close the gap between the language of our domain and the database. Queries
written in TypeQL are easily readable. Carefully designed database xref:development/schema.adoc#_schema[schema] lets us
use the terminology of the business domain, making our queries sound familiar to subject-matter experts. This new
paradigm gives us a higher level of flexibility and expressivity to simplify our work and tackle domains that
seemed impossibly complex before.

TypeQL and TypeDB allow us to build a data model with entity, relation, and attribute types. Inheritance allows us to
define a hierarchy of subtypes and reduce complexity, while rules and relations with type constraints on their
role-players further enhance our schema. These abstractions provide a higher-level framework to build intuitive
and understandable models.

// We can use the power of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph[hypergraphs] without the need to understand graphs!

In other databases, we implement relations with a join table (SQL) or an edge between two vertices
(graph databases). TypeDB relations generalize both: they flexibly relate one, two, or any number of roles. And each
role can be played by any types defined as role-players for this particular role in the schema.

////
In other databases, relations may be implemented with a join table
(xref:../../12-comparisons/00-sql-and-typeql.adoc[SQL]), or an edge between two vertices
(xref:../../12-comparisons/02-graph-databases-and-typedb.adoc[graph] databases). TypeDB relations generalize both: they
flexibly relate one, two, or any number of data instances at the same time.
////

This expanded idea of a relation is more powerful than either SQL or graph relations. However, we can further
improve this idea: if we allow relations not just to specify which instances relate to each other but also _how_
they relate by adding context. This has been implemented in the form of a role.

Any relation type specifies one or many roles connected by this relation. Any type in a schema can play roles
that were explicitly defined in the type definition. Roles have labels that provide the context and type
constraints for roles to enforce this context.

Finally, we can use the reasoning engine to infer new data based on the patterns found in the database. To do
that, we define rules in the database schema. Rules can dramatically shorten complex queries (e.g., transitivity of
relations), perform xref:development/infer.adoc#_explain_query[explainable] knowledge discovery, and implement business
logic at the database level.

1. First, use the xref:installation.adoc[installation guide] to install TypeDB on the local machine.

2. The TypeDB journey starts with our xref:quickstart-guide.adoc[Quickstart guide].
+
It goes through the step-by-step process of creating a new database, applying schema, loading sample data,
   and querying. The resulting environment is suitable for executing most examples in our documentation.
   On top of that it familiarizes users with TypeDB Studio â€” IDE, specifically designed for TypeDB
   database management and development.
