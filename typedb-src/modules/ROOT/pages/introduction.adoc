// tag::typedb-poly-definition[]
TypeDB is a polymorphic database with a <<_pera,conceptual data model>>,
a strong subtyping system,
a symbolic <<_infer,reasoning engine>>,
and a beautiful and elegant type-theoretic language: <<_declarative,TypeQL>>.
// end::typedb-poly-definition[]

On top of that, TypeDB is a transactional NoSQL database management system with
xref:development/connect.adoc#_acid_guarantees[ACID guarantees],
a robust asynchronous native API based on gRPC, and
a specialized IDE (xref:clients::studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio]).

We crafted TypeDB following a completely new, highly expressive *database paradigm* based on four key components:

* <<_data_model>>
* <<_type_system>>
* <<_typeql>>
* <<_inference_engine>>

[#_data_model]
== Polymorphic database model

TypeDB is based on a polymorphism-enhanced *conceptual* data model.
Conceptual data models are the starting point of designing any complex database application:
they are high-level models
that describe domains and their structured data in terms of conceptual entities and relations,
readable attributes, as well as the data dependencies between them.
Enhancing conceptual data models with inheritance and interface polymorphism gives them the further capability
of expressing concept abstractions and dependency abstractions.

TypeDB implements the *Polymorphic Entity-Relation-Attribute* (<<_pera,PERA>>) model,
an extension of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model[Chen’s entity-relationship (ER) model].
The PERA model allows database schemas
to be built directly from the conceptual models used frequently to represent domains and their data.
By enhancing these models with polymorphism,
TypeDB can avoid a long list of cumbersome workarounds and hacks needed when working with other data models.

See the <<_pera>> below.

//#todo Add links to further documentation

[#_pera]
[discrete]
=== Example

Entities, relations, and attributes are all first-class citizens in a data model
allowing for expressive modeling without normalization or reification.
There are three root types: `entity`, `relation`, and `attribute`;
and they can be subtyped to create user-defined types.

All data stored in a database must be instantiated from types defined in the schema.

.A simple PERA model example
=====
Before inserting or retrieving any data, you need to define a TypeDB database
xref:typeql::fundamentals.adoc#_schema[schema].
//#todo Change the link to the Schema page
A schema defined with a xref:typeql::schema/define-types.adoc[Define] query, for example:

.Schema example
[,typeql]
----
define

person sub entity,
    owns name;

user sub person,
    owns username,
    plays group-membership:member;

user-group sub entity,
    owns name,
    plays group-membership:group;

group-membership sub relation,
    owns date-added,
    relates group,
    relates member;

name sub attribute, value string;
username sub attribute, value string;
date-added sub attribute, value datetime;
----

The following schema can be visualized as a graph with a TypeDB Studio (IDE):

[caption=""]
.Schema visualization (TypeDB Studio)
image::intro-schema-example.png[Schema example,width = 50%, link=self]

You can clearly see that all attributes visualized as ellipses, entities as rectangles, and relations as diamonds.

To insert some sample data, use the following xref:typeql::data/insert.adoc[Insert] query:

.Insert query example
[,typeql]
----
insert
    $u isa user,
        has username "john117";

    $g isa user-group,
        has name "admins";

    $m (member: $u, group: $g) isa group-membership;
----

To retrieve the data, use the xref:typeql::data/get.adoc[Get] query:

.Get query example
[,typeql]
----
match
    $u isa user,
        has username $un;

    $g isa user-group,
        has name "admins";

    $m (member: $u, group: $g) isa group-membership;
get $un;
----

The above query returns usernames of all users, that are members of the `admins` user-group.
=====

[#_type_system]
== Extensible strong type system

Under the hood of TypeDB’s data model lies a powerful type system that formalizes the PERA model.
TypeDB’s <<_strong_type_system,strong type system>> makes database applications safe and robust.
This includes the semantic validation of all queries,
which avoids otherwise hard-to-spot inconsistencies in data insertions or query patterns.
It also means that database schemas can be easily manipulated and extended "on the fly"
without users needing to worry about existing queries breaking or data being orphaned.

Since types can be <<_polymorphic_query_example,polymorphically queried>>,
the results of queries automatically extend
to include new valid types that are added to the schema after the query is written.
This minimizes the need to maintain and update queries when the schema is extended,
so long as the semantic intent of the query remains the same.

See the <<_strong_type_system>> below.

[#_strong_type_system]
[discrete]
=== Example

TypeDB brings the benefits of strong typing in modern programming languages to the database, allowing developers
to use abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism when modeling and querying data.

.Example of a type hierarchy
=====
Type hierarchy is defined in a schema, so let's define a new one in an empty database:

.Schema
[,typeql]
----
define

user sub entity,
    owns username,
    owns password-hash,
    owns email,
    plays group-membership:member;

person sub user,
    owns name;

bot sub user,
    owns security-token;

user-group sub entity,
    owns name,
    plays group-membership:group;

group-membership sub relation,
    owns date-added,
    relates group,
    relates member;

username sub attribute, value string;
password-hash sub attribute, value string;
email sub attribute, value string;
name sub attribute, value string;
security-token sub attribute, value string;
date-added sub attribute, value datetime;
----

The above query defines a schema, where the `person` type subtypes `users`, while previous had it reversed.
It can be explained by classification, as in previous example, we could classify a person as either a user or not.
In this example, we want to classify users between a living person and a bot.

See below a TypeDB Studio visualization of that schema:

[caption=""]
.Type hierarchy example schema graph visualization
image::intro-hierarchy-schema.png[Type hierarchy,width = 50%, link=self]

//#todo Add some queries with validation showcase

For more information on how strong our type system is, see the xref:typeql::fundamentals.adoc#_types[Types] section on
xref:typeql::fundamentals.adoc[Fundamentals page] in xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL documentation].
=====

We can use polymorphic queries and type hierarchy to our advantage
by querying for supertypes to get all possible results, including subtypes.

[#_polymorphic_query_example]
.Example of a polymorphic query
=====
Consider the following schema.
It differs from the previous one, so it should be applied to a new (empty) database:

.Schema
[,typeql]
----
define

person sub entity,
    owns name;

user sub person,
    owns email @unique;

admin sub user;

name sub attribute, value string;
email sub attribute, value string;
----

We can insert instances of both the `user` and the `person` types with the following
xref:typeql::data/insert.adoc[Insert] query:

.Inserting data
[,typeql]
----
insert
    $u isa user,
        has name "Boris Monson",
        has email "boris@vaticle.com";
    $p isa person,
        has name "Peter Griffel";
----

Now let's xref:typeql::data/get.adoc[Get] all instances of the supertype `person`:

.Retrieving data
[,typeql]
----
match $p isa person, has $a;
----

See below a TypeDB Studio visualization of the results:

[caption=""]
.Retrieved data visualization (TypeDB Studio)
image::intro-get.png[poly,width = 50%, link=self]

Both supertype and subtype instances are retrieved, while the Get query mentioned only supertype.
=====

[#_typeql]
== Expressive fully declarative query language

TypeDB features the type-theoretic query language, TypeQL,
//#todo Add link to TypeQL Reference?
which simultaneously serves as a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language[Data Definition Language,window=_blank] and a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language[Data Manipulation Language,window=_blank]
for TypeDB queries.
TypeQL is a near-natural and fully declarative database query language comprising composable patterns, allowing the user
to create queries without the need to consider execution strategy -- all optimizations are handled directly by TypeDB.
The pattern-based syntax of TypeQL is intuitive and flexible, mirroring natural language statements,
and allowing for all parts of patterns to be variabilized.

<<_declarative,TypeQL>> is designed specifically for expressing what data looks like, not how to get it.
There are no joins, no unions, and no need for ordered query logic.
TypeQL can natively model and implement all forms of type polymorphism,
including type inheritance, type interfaces, and even parametric query patterns.
With these capabilities,
TypeQL solves the problem of object-relational mismatch
and ensures interoperability with many modern programming languages and complex object-oriented features.
It enables engineers to work with flexible, extendable, and adaptable data models,
making it easier to manage, query, and reason over complex data structures.

See the <<_declarative>> below.

[#_declarative]
[discrete]
=== Example
//=== Fully declarative query language

Data queries are based on powerful yet simple patterns, using types defined in a schema of a database.
Those patterns are easily readable and composable!
We can add new statements to any place in a pattern, and we can even combine multiple patterns,
to retrieve all matching data in just one query.

.Data definition example
=====
Let's start by defining a simple schema in an empty database:

.Simple schema
[,typeql]
----
define

person sub entity,
    owns name;

user sub person,
    owns email;

name sub attribute, value string;
email sub attribute, value string;
----

The above query defines two entities and two attributes.

Let's add some more type definitions and send the following
xref:typeql::schema/define-types.adoc[Define] query to the same database:

.Intermediate schema
[,typeql]
----
define

user owns email @unique,
    owns username,
    owns password-hash;

user-group sub entity,
    owns name;

username sub attribute, value string;
password-hash sub attribute, value string;
----

We added two more attribute types to the schema and ownership of them to an existing type.
We also added a new entity, owning an existing attribute type.

Now let's extend our schema again and add some relation to the schema of the same database,
but this time we will send the final schema entirely,
repeating the parts, that are already in the schema of the database.
To do this, send the following Define query:

.Full schema
[,typeql]
----
define

person sub entity,
    owns name;

user sub person,
    owns email @unique,
    owns username,
    owns password-hash,
    plays group-membership:member;

user-group sub entity,
    owns name,
    plays group-membership:group;

group-membership sub relation,
    owns date-added,
    relates group,
    relates member;

username sub attribute, value string;
name sub attribute, value string;
email sub attribute, value string;
password-hash sub attribute, value string;
date-added sub attribute, value datetime;
----

By sending the Define query to the database, we extended the schema of the database without causing any problems,
because statements in a Define query are idempotent.
//#todo Add a link to idempotency explanation
=====

.Data manipulation example
=====
The following Insert query creates two instances of the `person` type, and two groups and assigns a membership in one
of the groups for one of the users:

.Insert query example
[,typeql]
----
insert
$u1 isa user,
    has name "Bob",
    has username "bob90",
    has email "bob@vaticle.com";

$u2 isa user,
    has name "Alex",
    has username "al-capucino";

$g1 isa user-group,
    has name "admins";

$g2 isa user-group,
    has name "users";

$m (member: $u1, group: $g1) isa group-membership;
----

To get back the inserted name and email for the user with username `bob90`, use the following query:

.Simple Get query
[,typeql]
----
match
    $p isa person,
        has name $n,
        has username "bob90",
        has email $e;
get $n, $e;
----

Now let's query for all users and their owned attributes:

.Another simple Get query
[,typeql]
----
match $u isa user, has $a;
----

It should return pairs of `$u` and `$a`, where `$u` is an instance of the `user` type (and its subtypes)
that has attribute `$a` of any attribute type.

Now let's do match-insert to showcase the insertion of data with the context from the database:

.Insert query with a match clause
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person;
$g isa user-group,
    has name "users";
not { ($p, $g) isa group-membership; };
insert
(member:$p, group:$g) isa group-membership;
----

The above query executes `match` clause first and then `insert` clause using matched data.
The `match` clause matches all instances of `person` type and all instances of `user-group` type, owning an attribute of
type `name` and value `users` such as there is no `group-membership` relation between them.
Then the `insert` clause inserts a `group-membership` relation between all matched instances of `person`
and all matched instances of `group`.
=====

[#_inference_engine]
== Powerful explainable inference engine

TypeDB allows you to integrate your application logic directly into the database,
by providing a type-theoretic symbolic reasoning engine that evaluates user-specified rules.
Rules are written using the same patterns as queries and resolved against the schema,
combining the flexibility of polymorphism with the power of symbolic reasoning.
By employing sequential and recursive triggering of rules,
highly complex logical behaviors can arise from rules that are individually very simple,
mirroring the true semantic logic of complex data domains.

When utilizing symbolic <<_infer,reasoning>>, new fact generation occurs at query time,
ensuring that generated data is never stale.
By using rules to govern data dependencies within the database,
all inferred data can be made to have a single source of truth,
preventing data conflicts from ever occurring.
This ensures that the database is always in a consistent and current state,
preventing the need for pre-computation cycles.

See the <<_infer>> below.

[#_infer]
[discrete]
=== Example

Inference in TypeDB can be either rule-based or type-based.

Rule inference is a logical deduction based on a set of rules defined in a schema.
Rules represent logic embedded in a schema.

When `read` transactions are running with the _inference_ option enabled,
TypeDB can deduce new (virtual) attribute ownerships and relations if they influence the query results.

Virtual (inferred) data is not persisted and will be lost when the transaction is closed.

.Inferring new data example
=====
.Everyone is a dude rule example
[,typeql]
----
define

rule everyone-is-a-dude:
    when {
        $p isa person;
    } then {
        $p has name "Dude";
    };
----

The above example will add a `name` attribute with value `Dude` to every existing person.

Let’s add to the above schema an ability for user-groups to be members of other user-groups.
=====

.Transitive relations example
=====
.Add an ability for a group to be a member of a group
[,typeql]
----
define

user-group plays group-membership:member;
----

Now, we can add a new rule to enable transitive group membership. We can include Group A in Group B,
so that every member of Group A will become a member of Group B through the transitivity of membership, as follows:

`person` -> Group A -> Group B.

.Transitive group membership rule example
[,typeql]
----
define

rule transitive-group-membership:
   when {
      (group: $g1, member: $g2) isa group-membership;
      (group: $g2, member: $p) isa group-membership;
   } then {
      (group: $g1, member: $p) isa group-membership;
   };
----

The above rule works for any number of groups.

For example, if we insert data of group-membership according to the following:

`person` -> Group A -> Group B -> Group C -> Group D -> Group E

where `->` -- means a `group-membership` relation with an entity on the left of the -> playing the role of `member`
and the entity on the right playing the role of `group`. Then the transitivity, implemented by
the `transitive-group-memmbership` rule, will make `person` into a member of all groups from A to E.

For more information on rule inference, see the xref:typeql::schema/define-rules.adoc[] page
in xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL documentation].
