:summary: A simple example with a prototype application to run against a TypeDB database.
:tabs-sync-option:

The following sample app implementations are all designed to connect to the xref:tutorials/iam-schema.adoc[IAM]
database located at the TypeDB server with `0.0.0.0:1729` address. Please make sure to have TypeDB server running
with the `iam` database created and both *schema* and *data* loaded. Use the
xref:install-and-run.adoc[Installation guide] to prepare the server
and the xref:home/quickstart-guide.adoc[Quickstart guide] to prepare the database.

The sample application has the following implementations:

* <<_python_implementation,Python>>
* <<_java_implementation,Java>>
* <<_node_js_implementation,Node.js>>

[#_explanation]
== Explanation

=== List names and e-mails for all users that have them

TypeQL query used:

[,typeql]
----
match $u isa user, has full-name $n, has email $e;
----

*Simple explanation*: we go through all entities of `user` subtype (assigning a variable `$u` for those) that have
`full-name` attribute (variable `$n` assigned for those) and `email` attribute (variable `$e`). Since we don't have an
explicit `get` statement it is assumed that we get all the variables that were assigned in the query.

[NOTE]
====
Note that users that do not have `full-name` or `email` attributes added to them will not be shown in
the results of this request. Additionally, users that have multiple full-names or emails will be mentioned more than once.

For more information, see the xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals/patterns.adoc#_solutions[matching patterns] explanation.

        cVar("p").rel(cVar("u")).rel(cVar("pa")).isa("permission"),
        cVar("o").isa("object").has("path", cVar("fp")),
        cVar("pa").rel(cVar("o")).rel(cVar("va")).isa("access")
).get(cVar("fp"));
----
--
====

*Simple explanation*: we look for a `user` (variable `$u`) with attribute `full-name` of value `Kevin Morrison` assigned.
Then we search for a `permission` relation (`$p`) in between this user `$u` and potential access `$pa`.
Finally, we state that an `object` (`$o`) with a path `$fp` should be a part of `$pa` `access` relation, without
having to specify what kind of action `$va` it should be. From all the variables requested, we only want it to
return the `path` attributes (`$fp`) of any `object` that the `user` has `permission` to `access`.

[NOTE]
====
Note that users and files don't have a singular relation that connects them directly. According to the `iam`
xref:tutorials/iam-schema.adoc[schema] we need two relations to connect them: `permission` and `access`. Both
relations must be used to make a decision of whether a user has access to a file.

=== List all the files Kevin has view_file access to (with inference)

TypeQL query builder clause #1 used:

[,java]
----
TypeQLMatch.Limited getQuery = TypeQL.match( // Java query builder to prepare TypeQL query string
        cVar("u").isa("user").has("full-name", "Kevin Morrison"),
        cVar("p").rel(cVar("u")).rel(cVar("pa")).isa("permission"),
        cVar("o").isa("object").has("path", cVar("fp")),
        cVar("pa").rel(cVar("o")).rel(cVar("va")).isa("access"),
        cVar("va").isa("action").has("name", "view_file")
).get(cVar("fp")).sort(cVar("fp")).offset(0).limit(5);
----
--
====

*Simple explanation*: This is a similar request to the previous one. The difference is we set the type of action (`$va`)
that the user has access to the `view_file`. We still get only `path` (`$fp`), but can now sort in ascending order
and get it in two portions: this particular request gets the very first five entries. Later ones will get another five,
starting from number six.

[NOTE]
====
Note that Kevin has been assigned only `modify_file` access, and the `view_file` access is being inferred by a
xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals/inference.adoc#_rules[rule]. To use inference in this query we modify TypeDB options and send the modified set
of options to the transaction call.
====

[NOTE]
====
To make things a bit more interesting we split this into two separate queries by using an `offset` keyword: we
get the first five results and then five more results with an offset of five. To be able to do that we apply sorting
of the results by `path` variable. Otherwise, we can't guarantee the results will be in the same order every time we
send a request.
====

=== Insert a new file and then insert an access relation to it

First, we generate a new value for the `path` attribute of the query (stored locally in the variable called filepath),
consisting of `logs/` prefix, current date and time in compact format, and `.log` ending.

The following queries are displayed in their final form, with the `path` attribute generated value.

Query #1:

[tabs]
====
TypeQL syntax::

[,typeql]
----
insert $f isa file, has path 'logs/2023-06-30T12:04:36.351.log';

TypeQLInsert insertQuery = TypeQL.insert(cVar("f").isa("file").has("path", "logs/2023-06-30T12:04:36.351.log"));
----
--
====

*Simple explanation*: we insert a `file` entity (instance of data) that has an attribute `path` with the value we
generated before.

Query #2:

[tabs]
====
TypeQL syntax::
+
--
[,typeql]
----
match
  $f isa file, has path 'logs/2023-06-30T12:04:36.351.log';
  $vav isa action, has name 'view_file';
insert
  ($vav, $f) isa access;
----
--

Java Builder syntax::
+
--
[,java]
----
insertQuery = TypeQL.match( // Java query builder to prepare TypeQL query string
        cVar("f").isa("file").has("path", "logs/2023-06-30T12:04:36.351.log"),
        cVar("vav").isa("action").has("name", "view_file")
                )
        .insert(cVar("pa").rel(cVar("vav")).rel(cVar("f")).isa("access"));
----
--
====

*Simple explanation*: we look for a `file` entity that has an attribute `path` with the value we generated before.
And we find an `action`, that has a `name` attribute with the value of `view_file`. Then we insert an `access`
relation in between the `file` and the `action`.

[NOTE]
====
Note that we create `file` first. If we try to set `access` to a nonexistent `file` our request will succeed
(if we don't make any mistakes in the syntax of the query) but will not insert any new data (relation). After both
requests are done we commit the write transaction. It is important not to forget to commit changes.
