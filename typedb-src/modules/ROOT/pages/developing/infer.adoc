[#_how_to_use_inference]
== How to use inference

Inference is enabled as a Read xref:connecting/overview.adoc#_transactions[transaction] option.

=== TypeDB Studio

To send a request with inference enabled in xref:connecting/studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio] follow these steps:

. Ensure the btn:[Session type] (`schema` / `data`) switch is set to `data` (next to the database dropdown).
. Ensure the btn:[Transaction type] (write / read) switch is set to `read`.
. Ensure the btn:[infer] button (next to the transaction type switch) is pushed (shown in *green* text).
. Click the `+` icon at the top of the *Text editor* panel.
. Copy the TypeQL query into the *Text editor* panel.
. Click the green "play" button.

=== TypeDB Console

Set the `infer` option to `true` when starting the read transaction. For example:

----
transaction typedb data read --infer true
----

=== TypeDB drivers

Set the `infer` option to `True` when starting the read transaction.

For example (in Python):

// #todo Consider adding other languages-

[,python]
----
typedb_options = TypeDBOptions()  # Initialising a new set of options
typedb_options.infer = True  # Enabling inference in this new set of options
with session.transaction(TransactionType.READ, typedb_options) as transaction:

[#_example]
== Example

In the IAM database there are multiple rules, but we will use the one described at the
xref:tutorials/iam-schema.adoc[IAM schema explanation] page.

[,typeql]
----
rule add-view-permission:
    when {
        $modify isa action, has name "modify_file";
        $view isa action, has name "view_file";
        $ac_modify (object: $obj, action: $modify) isa access;
        $ac_view (object: $obj, action: $view) isa access;
        (subject: $subj, access: $ac_modify) isa permission;
    } then {
        (subject: $subj, access: $ac_view) isa permission;
    };
----

By default, the IAM dataset used in the xref:home::quickstart.adoc[Quickstart guide] sets permissions only for the
`modify_file` action.

But the IAM schema has the rule called `add-view-permission` (see above) to infer permission to `view_file` access
from the `modify_file` permission for the same file. The `view_file` action access permission does not exist in the
database, but it can be inferred by the rule.

To do so, let's use the following query:

[,typeql]
----
match
    $p isa person, has full-name "Kevin Morrison";
    $o isa object, has path $o-path;
    $a isa action, has name "view_file";
    $ac(object: $o, action: $a) isa access;
    $pe(subject: $p, access: $ac) isa permission;
get $o-path;
----

The above query should return `path` values for most files if the inference option is *enabled*. Without the
inference enabled the query should not return any results (as the default IAM dataset contains no permissions for
access with `view_file` action).

=== Query explanation

The example is a `get` query that does the following:

. Finds `person` entity (`$p`) with an attribute `full-name` equal to the `Kevin Morrison` string value.
. Finds all `object` entities (`$o`) with a `path` attribute (`$o-path`).
. Finds `action` entity (`$a`) with `name` of `view-file`.
. Finds `access` relation (`$ac`) that relates `$o` (as `object`) to `$a` (as `action`).
. Finds all `permission` relations that relate `$p` (as `subject`) to `$ac` (as `access`).
. Filters the results to receive only the `$o-path` variable that complies with all the statements above.

In short, it returns `path` attributes for every `object` that `person` with a `full-name` of `Kevin Morrison` has
permission to access with `action` with the `name` of `view_file`.

[#_explain_query]
== Explain query

There is specific type of query to use with the inferred results if we want them explained by a TypeDB server.

An Explain query does not use any TypeQL syntax.

When we get a result of a Get query that was performed with both `inference` and `explain` options *enabled* we
can use an Explain query to request additional information on exactly how the instances of data were inferred.

To do that use the `explainables` method on the `get` query result (`ConceptMap`). It returns a stream of `explainable`
objects. Send an `explainable` object with an *Explain* query to get a stream of `explanations`.

Every `explanation` include information about what rule was used to obtain this inferred result,
condition of the rule, conclusion of the rule, and variable mapping.

=== Python example
//#todo Add examples on other languages

The following code (provided with a TypeDB server with IAM database from
xref:home::quickstart.adoc[Quickstart guide]) can infer `view_file` permission for multiple files for a single
user and explain every inferred result. Basically, we repeat the previous example and then request explanation of
relation `$pe`.

[,python]
----
from typedb.driver import TypeDB, SessionType, TransactionType, TypeDBOptions

with TypeDB.core_driver("0.0.0.0:1729") as driver:  # Connect to TypeDB server
    with driver.session("iam", SessionType.DATA) as session:
        print("\nRequest #1: Explain query â€” Files that Kevin Morrison has view access to (with explanation)")
        typedb_options = TypeDBOptions()  # Initialising a new set of options
        typedb_options.infer = True  # Enabling inference in this new set of options
        typedb_options.explain = True
        with session.transaction(TransactionType.READ, typedb_options) as transaction:
            typeql_read_query = "match $p isa person, has full-name $p-fname; $o isa object, has path $o-path;" \
                                "$a isa action, has name 'view_file'; $ac(object: $o, action: $a) isa access;" \
                                "$pe(subject: $p, access: $ac) isa permission; $p-fname = 'Kevin Morrison';" \
                                "get $o-path; sort $o-path asc;"
            iterator = transaction.query().get(typeql_read_query)
            i = 0
            for item in iterator:  # Iterating through results
                i += 1
                explainable_relations = item.explainables().relations()
                e = 0
                for explainable in explainable_relations:
                    e += 1
                    explain_iterator = transaction.query().explain(explainable_relations[explainable])
                    ex = 0
                    for explanation in explain_iterator:
                        ex += 1

                        print("\nRead result #:", i, ", File path:", item.get(cVar("o-path")).as_attribute().get_value())
                        print("Explainable #:", e, ", Explained variable:", explainable)
                        print("Explainable object:", explainable_relations[explainable])
                        print("Explainable part of query:", explainable_relations[explainable].conjunction())
                        print("Explanation #:", ex)

                        print("\nRule: ", explanation.rule().get_label())
                        print("Condition: ", explanation.condition())
                        print("Conclusion: ", explanation.conclusion())
                        print("Variables used in explanation: ", explanation.variable_mapping())
                        print("----------------------------------------------------------")
----

////
Use enumerate() instead of simple counter:

    iterator = transaction.query().get(typeql_read_query)
    for i, item in enumerate(iterator):  # Iterating through results
        explainable_relations = item.explainables().relations()
        for e, explainable in enumerate(explainable_relations):
            explain_iterator = transaction.query().explain(explainable_relations[explainable])
            for ex, explanation in enumerate(explain_iterator):
////

The script above runs the query from the <<_example,example>> in the previous section. The inference option provides
the result of 10 files (by default in the IAM database from the xref:home::quickstart.adoc[Quickstart guide]).
And `explain` option enables the `explainables` to be received and used in the *explain* queries (one explain query
for each result that needs to be explained).

==== Output

The result should be similar to the following:

----
Read result #: 10 , File path: zlckt.ts
Explainable #: 1 , Explained variable: pe
Explainable object: <typedb.concept.answer.concept_map._ConceptMap.Explainable object at 0x105cb34f0>
Explainable part of query: { $pe (subject:$p, access:$ac); $pe isa permission; }
Explanation #: 1

Variables used in explanation:  {'p': {'subj'}, 'ac': {'ac_view'}, 'pe': {'_'}}

----------------------------------------------------------
----

==== Explanation parsing

===== Get label

The `explanation.rule().get_label()` method returns the name of the rule that was used for this particular inference,
hence the result of which is being explained:

----
add-view-permission
----

===== Variable mapping

The `explanation.variable_mapping()` method returns mapping of the variable names in the query with variable names in
the rule:

----
{'p': {'subj'}, 'ac': {'ac_view'}, 'pe': {'_'}}
----

===== Condition

The ``explanation.condition()``method returns the condition of the rule written with the exact matched instances of data.

For the rule condition defined as:

----
$modify isa action, has name "modify_file";
$view isa action, has name "view_file";
$ac_modify (object: $obj, action: $modify) isa access;
$ac_view (object: $obj, action: $view) isa access;
(subject: $subj, access: $ac_modify) isa permission; \
----

We got the condition explained with particular instances from the IAM dataset:

----
[_1/_StringAttribute[name:0x836f800328000b6d6f646966795f66696c65]]
[_2/_StringAttribute[name:0x836f8003280009766965775f66696c65]]
[_3/_Relation[permission:0x847080038000000000000001]]
[ac_modify/_Relation[access:0x8470800a8000000000000003]]
[ac_view/_Relation[access:0x8470800a8000000000000011]]
[modify/_Entity[operation:0x826e800c8000000000000001]]
[obj/_Entity[file:0x826e80098000000000000004]]
[subj/_Entity[person:0x826e80018000000000000001]]
[view/_Entity[operation:0x826e800c8000000000000000]]
----

The example above contains additional line breakers for convenience. The syntax of the condition is similar to
the following pattern:

----
[<rule_variable_label>/<RootType>[<Type>:<IID>]]
----

[NOTE]
====
Instead of a <RootType> placeholder we can get one of this:

- `_Entity`
- `_Relation`
- `_Attribute`
- `_EntityType`
- `_RelationType`
- `_AttributeType`
- `RoleType`
====

Those are exact instances of data that were matched by the rule. For example, `obj` is a `file` type entity that has
an attribute of `path` type with the value `zlckt.ts`. We didn't get the `path` in the explanation because it wasn't
mentioned in the rule, but was able to obtain it by the API call from the get query result:

----
item.get(cVar("o-path")).as_attribute().get_value())
----

===== Conclusion

The `explanation.conclusion()` method returns the conclusion of the rule written with the exact instances of data
(including the inferred instance of data that exists only virtually -- as a result of the inference).

For the rule condition defined as:

----
(subject: $subj, access: $ac_view) isa permission;
----

We got the conclusion explained with particular instances from the IAM dataset:

----
[_/_Relation[permission:0x847080037fffffffffffffff]]
[_permission/_RelationType[label: permission]]
[_permission:access/_RoleType[label: permission:access]]
[_permission:subject/_RoleType[label: permission:subject]]
[ac_view/_Relation[access:0x8470800a8000000000000011]]
[subj/_Entity[person:0x826e80018000000000000001]]
----

The example above contains additional line breakers for convenience. The syntax of the condition is similar to
the following pattern:

----
[<rule_variable>/<RootType>[<Type>:<IID>]]
----

[NOTE]
====
Instead of a <RootType> placeholder we can get one of this:

- `_Entity`
- `_Relation`
- `_Attribute`
- `_EntityType`
- `_RelationType`
- `_AttributeType`
- `RoleType`

== Inference optimization

These are general tips for making queries with reasoning execute faster:

. Adding a limit to the query. Without a limit, the reasoning engine is forced to explore all possible ways to answer
the query exhaustively. If we only need 1 answer, adding `limit 1;` to the get query can significantly improve
query times.
. Using the same transaction for multiple reasoning queries. Because inferred data is cleared between transactions,
running the same or similar queries within one transaction can reuse previously inferred data. Combined with a limit
on the query, it might be possible to avoid having to do any new reasoning at all.
. For complex queries, it can also be beneficial to add more CPU cores, as the reasoning engine is able to explore
more paths in the database concurrently.
