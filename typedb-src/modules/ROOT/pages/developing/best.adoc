== Schema modeling

There are only three root types:

  * `entity`
  * `relation`
  * `attribute`

An *attribute type* (subtype of the `attribute` root type) is a single concept with a fixed value in a given domain.
That attribute is a property of the domain rather than of its owners, and so is not uniquely defined by any concepts
that might own it, nor does it require any owners to exist: a name of value "Bob" can be owned by either no one, one
particular person, or multiple people.

An *entity type* (subtype of the `entity` root type) is a single concept with an independent existence. It might
practically require other entities to exist, such as a car that cannot exist without its parts, but can be
conceptualized without reference to those other entities: a car can be imagined without considering its parts.

A *relation type* (subtype of the `relation` root type) is a single concept with an existence that depends on at
least one other concept. It cannot be conceptualized without those concepts: it is impossible to imagine a marriage
without considering its spouses.

=== Tips for beginners

* The best way to start modeling a database schema is to model entity types first and then proceed with connecting
them with relation types and assign ownership of attribute types to them later.
* Schema of a DB defines a vocabulary for queries to that particular DB. The closer the schema resembles the real-life
data, the simpler it is to read queries for people familiar with the terminology. Consider putting extra effort into
the following aspects of designing a DB schema: accurate type labels/names, an intuitive hierarchy of subtypes, and
designing relations in the most meaningful way.
* Creating a schema is an iterative process. Don't forget that the schema of a database can be updated. Consider
testing schema on a small dataset first. The sooner the schema will be adapted to all use cases and tested for edge
cases -- the smaller amount of work will be required to adapt all other code for changes in the schema.
* Implementing drastic changes to a database schema is possible by undefining old types/rules (after undefining
all subtypes and deleting all instances of data of these types) and defining new ones. We can even use driver API
or TypeDB Studio to rename types without deleting them. However, it might be easier to create a new database and
upload new schema and data from scratch.
* It's easier to debug queries using TypeDB Studio, than with any TypeDB driver, because Studio manages sessions
and transactions for us, and can visualize query results.

=== Advanced tips

* When inserting instances of a relation, it is not necessary to define all of its *role players*. But this
represents an incomplete information state, such as a marriage in which only one of the spouses is known. While a
relation can be instantiated with only one role player, and sometimes a relation can logically exist without some of its
role players, it's not always the case. So an instance of a relation can imply the existence of its missing role players.
* In an n-ary relation, every combination of (*n-1*)-ary relation between its role players should be valid.
For example, a ternary relation between an actor, a film, and a role is valid because the following binary
relations are valid:
 ** actor and film,
 ** actor and role,
 ** film and role.
* TypeQL extends the relational functionality of SQL and strongly types it, by separating entities and relations
into distinct *concepts* with distinct attributes.
+
Relational tables (SQL) are homogeneous in that they can be used both to represent a list of relation's role players
(a join table) or a list of entity's attributes (a regular table). These two types of table are indistinguishable
from the perspective of an SQL database engine without additional context or constraints.

* Each schema construct incurs a computational cost when traversed as part of a query. Sorted in the order of
*increasing* cost, the constructs are:
+
  . Attributes
  . Entities
  . Subtypes
  . Binary relations
  . N-ary relations
  . Rules
+
Thus, it is important to consider the value of employing a rule, as the gain in query simplicity can be offset by
the computational cost.

* Composition (using role names to describe the functions that entities/relations perform) is generally preferred over
*inheritance* (using subtyping to describe those functions). This is because a type `a` should be a subtype of
`b` if every instance of `a` is necessarily also an instance of `b` (within the domain). For example, making `car`
a subtype of `product` should be avoided as not every car is necessarily a product. The most general approach
would be to make `car` a subtype of `vehicle` and then have `car` play the role of `product` in, for instance, a
`purchase` relation.
+
In domains where cars are always products, for instance in a car dealership database (that might also sell
other products: parts, add-ons, and extended warranties, etc.), it might be safe to make it a subtype of
`product`; however, this then means that the database cannot scale to consider cars in contexts other than being
products. This could be a worthwhile trade-off in very well specified models.

== Developing a query

TypeDB query engine will try to retrieve/process all required concepts in the most optimal and efficient way.

If there is any problem with a query, we recommend trying to execute it with TypeDB Studio just to see whether
the problem lies within the query itself, or other parts of the application logic, like connection control.

To optimize execution of a query try to do the following:

* Keep the number of databases on TypeDB ser **under 10** since it's optimised for smaller numbers of databases per
  server.
* Avoid long-running transactions which can result in conflicts and resource contention.
* A good principle to follow is that transactions group logically coherent queries.
* Limit the number of concepts being processed by adding additional
  xref:typeql::data/match.adoc#_patterns_overview[constraints] to variables in `match` clauses.
* Limit the number of results returned by using pagination (limit + offset) or
  xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_modifiers[aggregation] when possible.
* Disable inference if it's not needed in the transaction.
* Consider sending all queries before starting to iterate through responses. TypeDB processes most queries
  asynchronously.

=== Async query processing

All TypeQL queries sent to a TypeDB server will be processed by it asynchronously. Local
processing can take place while waiting for responses to be received. Take advantage of these asynchronous queries
to mask network round-trip costs and increase throughput. For example, to perform 10 get queries in a transaction,
it's best to send them all to the server before iterating over any of their answers.

Queries that return answers (e.g., get, insert) return them as Streams/Iterators or Futures (if there can be only a
single answer). These can then be awaited, or iterated, to retrieve the answers as they are computed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When a transaction is committed or closed, all of its asynchronous queries are completed first.
====

=== API

Data retrieved from a TypeDB database consists of concepts and is delivered in the form of
xref:developing/response.adoc#_conceptmap[ConceptMaps]. Use the methods introduced by the TypeDB driver API to obtain more
information about the retrieved concept. To explore the concept's surroundings, the API has methods to traverse the
neighbors of a specific concept instance to obtain more insights.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When retrieving a large number of concepts it is more efficient to do that with a TypeQL query.
====

=== Troubleshooting

The following are some of the most common mistakes and misunderstandings that could cause errors.

==== Get clause alters results

A xref:typedb::developing/read.adoc#_get[get] clause can alter the set of returned results. For example:

[,typeql]
----
match $p isa person, has full-name $n; get $n;
----

The above query returns full-names (`$n`) owned by `$p` of the `person` type.

Are we to expect to have a full name for every person instance in the results? No.

. A person can have more than one attribute of type `full-name`. Every instance of attribute will get to the results.
. A person can have no attributes of type `full-name`. In that case the person will not be represented by variable
`$p`. That will person will not be accounted for.
. Finally, different people can have the same full names. In TypeDB that means different instances of `person` type
can own the same instance of `full-name` type. By filtering results to get only full-names we will receive a
deduplicated list of full-names. Because it's just a list of all attributes owned by `$p` type.

To get complete information about all full names of every person, we need to modify the query as follows:

[,typeql]
----
match $p isa person, has full-name $n; get $p, $n;
----

With this slight alteration (we added variable `$p` to the `get` clause) the response will consist of pairs of
`person` type object and its owned `full-name` attribute. Because of the `person` object in the response any
repeated full names (represented in a database by the very same single attribute) will now be returned in pair with
their owner. If a person has two `full-name` attributes, then the resulting response will contain two pairs with the
same `person` object but different `attributes`.

We can further improve the output by xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_modifiers[grouping] the results by `person`
and/or applying xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_modifiers[aggregation] to count the number of results.
