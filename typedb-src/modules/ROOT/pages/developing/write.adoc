There are multiple query types that can modify data in a TypeDB database:

* <<_insert>>
* <<_delete_query>>
* <<_update_query,Update>> (or match-delete-insert) query

To send a writing data query we need to use xref:connecting/overview.adoc#_transactions[Write transaction].

[IMPORTANT]
====
All examples provided on this page are designed for the IAM database schema and data.
To set the IAM database follow the xref:home::quickstart.adoc[].

[#_insert]
== Insert query

An Insert query is used to add new data to a TypeDB database.

Data can be inserted only as an instances of a type, existing in the database schema.

=== Syntax

Insert queries are written in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
[match <pattern>]
insert <pattern>
----

=== Behavior

See the xref:typeql::data/insert.adoc#_behavior[Insert query] page.

=== Examples

A simple insert example:

[,typeql]
----
insert $p isa person, has full-name "Bob";
----

A simple example with `match` clause:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $f isa file, has path "README.md";
insert
  $f has size-kb 55;
----

In the above example we matching an instances of `file` entity type that have attribute of `path` type with
the value `README.md`, and then we inserting an ownership of `size-kb` attribute with value `55` to every matched
entity.

A more complex example:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $s isa subject, has full-name "Pearle Goodman";
  $o isa object, has path "zewhb.java";
  $a isa action, has name "modify_file";
  $ac (object: $o, action: $a) isa access;
insert
  $p (subject: $s, access: $ac) isa permission;
----

The above query:

. Finds a `subject` (`$s`) whose `full-name` attribute has a value of `Pearle Goodman`.
. Finds an `object` (`$o`) whose `path` attribute has a value of `zewhb.java`.
. Finds an `action` (`$a`) whose name attribute has a value of `modify_file`.
. Finds an `access` relation (`$ac`) that relates the `$o` (as `access-object`) to `$a` (as `action`).
. Inserts a `permission` relation that relates `$s` (as `subject`) to the relation `$ac` (as
`access`).

In the IAM database this query should only insert a single instance of data of the `permission` type. But if any
statements in the `match` clause will match multiple results (e.g., if we insert a second instance of `subject` type
with owned `full-name` attribute of the `Pearle Goodman` value) the query can result if multiple inserts. One for
every matched pattern.

[#_delete_query]
== Delete query

A delete query can be used to remove data from a TypeDB database.

We can remove instances of types as well as references to them, like attribute ownerships.

=== Syntax

A delete query is always preceded by a `match` clause as we need to locate the existing data to delete first.

Delete queries are written in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
match <pattern>
delete <pattern>
----

=== Behavior

See the xref:typeql::data/delete.adoc#_behavior[Delete query] page.

=== Examples

A simple example:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has full-name "Bob";
delete
  $p isa person;
----

In the above query, `match` clause finds every `person` entity owning a `full-name` attribute with the value of
`Bob`. Then, it removes the matched entities.

A more complex example:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa subject, has full-name "Pearle Goodman";
  $a isa action, has name "modify_file";
  $ac (object: $o, action: $a) isa access;
  $pe (subject: $p, access: $ac) isa permission;
delete
  $pe isa permission;
----

The above query does the following:

. Finds a `subject` entity (`$p`), with `full-name` attribute value of `Pearle Goodman`.
. Finds an `action` entity (`$a`), with `name` attribute value of `modify_file`.
. Finds `access` relations (`$ac`) relating any `object` (as `object`) to the action `$a` (as `action`).
. Finds `permission` relations (`$pe`) relating the `subject` entity `$p` (as subject) to the `access`
relations `$ac` (as access).
. Deletes all matched permissions `$pe`.

In short, it removes all of the permissions that let Pearle Goodman to modify files.

[#_update_query]
== Update query

An update  query is just a `match-delete-insert`. It removes and then adds data based on the `match`, `delete`,
and `insert` xref:typeql::data/match.adoc#_patterns_overview[patterns].

=== Syntax

Updates are written in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
match <pattern>
delete <pattern>
insert <pattern>
----

=== Behavior

See the xref:typeql::data/update.adoc#_behavior[Update query] page.

=== Examples

A simple example:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has full-name "Masako Holley", has email $email;
delete
  $p has $email;
insert
  $p has email "m.holley@vaticle.com";
----

The above query, does the following:

. Finds all `person` entities (`$p`) that have a `full-name` attribute with a value of `Masako Holley` and have `email`
  attribute.
. Deletes an ownership of `$p` over its current `email` attribute. Take a note, that it happens regardless of its value.
. Makes `$p` the owner of an `email` attribute with a value of `m.holley@vaticle.com`.

If the person with such a `full-name` had more than one email, then the `match` clause produce more than one match and
both `delete` and `insert` clauses will be executed once per match. But a type can't own an attribute instance more
than once. Hence, the result will be the same -- only one `email` owned.

A more complex example:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has full-name "Pearle Goodman";
  $a_write isa action, has name "modify_file";
  $a_read isa action, has name "view_file";
  $ac_write (object: $o, action: $a_write) isa access;
  $ac_read (object: $o, action: $a_read) isa access;
  $pe (subject: $p, access: $ac_write) isa permission;
delete
  $pe (access: $ac_write);
insert
  $pe (access: $ac_read);
----

The above query does the following:

. Finds a `person` entity (`$p`) with a `full-name` of `Pearle Goodman`.
. Finds an `action` entity (`$a_write`) with `name` of `modify_file`).
. Finds an `action` entity (`$a_read`)  with `name` of `read_file`).
. Finds `access` relation (`$ac_write`) that relate an `object` (as `object`) to the `$a_write` (as `action`).
. Finds `access` relation (`$ac_read`) that relate an `object` (as `object`) to the `$a_read` (as `action`).
. Finds permission (`$pe`) that relate `$p` (as `subject`) to `$ac_write` (as `access`).
. Removes the `$ac_write` as a player of the `access` role in the `$pe`.
. Adds the `$ac_read` as a player of the `access` role in the `$pe`.

In short, all of Pearle Goodman's permissions with write access will become permissions with read access.

[NOTE]
====
After running the above query, all of the matched `access` relations `$ac_write` with `$a_write` as `action` still
exist, but no longer play a role in the matched `permission` relations.
