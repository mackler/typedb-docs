There is only one query type that can read data from a TypeDB database: <<_get>>.

[#_get]
== Get query

A Get query is used to retrieve data from a TypeDB database.

=== Syntax

Get queries are written in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
match <pattern>
  [get <variable> [(, <variable>)...];]
  [sort <variable> [asc|desc];]
  [offset <value>;]
  [limit <value>;]
  [group <variable>;]
  [count;] | [sum|max|min|mean|median|std <variable>;]
----

=== Behavior

See the xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_behavior[Get query] page.

=== Examples

A simple example:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has full-name "Kevin Morrison", has email $e;
get $e;
----

This example query contains the following variables:

* `$p`,
* `$e`.

The `full-name` attribute is not bound to a variable in this query.

The example above matches person (`$p`) that has a `full-name` attribute value of `Kevin Morrison`, and has `email`
attribute (`$e`). The `get` clause then filters the results to receive only the `email` (`$e`) attributes.

A more complex example:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $pe ($x, $y) isa permission;
  $x isa person, has full-name $x-n;
  $x-n contains "Kevin";
  $y (object: $o, action: $act) isa access;
  $act has name $act-n;
  $o has path $o-fp;
get $x-n, $act-n, $o-fp;
----

The example above uses a `match` clause to do the following:

. Find `permission` relation (`$pe`), connecting `$x` and `$y` variables.
. Find `$x` as instance of `person` entity type that has the `full-name` attribute with the value of `$x-n`.
. `$x-n` should contain string `Kevin`.
. Find `access` relation of `$o` as `object` role and `$act` as `action` role.
. `$act` should have the `name` attribute with the value of `$act-n`.
. `$o` should have the `path` attribute with the value of `$o-fp`.

The `get` clause then filters the answers from the `match` clause to retrieve only the following:

* `$x-n`,
* `$act-n`,
* `$o-fp`.

Every returned result should contain all three concepts.

An example with xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_modifiers[modifiers]:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $pe ($x, $y) isa permission;
  $x isa person, has full-name $x-n;
  $y (object: $o, action: $act) isa access;
  $act has name $act-n;
  $o has path $o-fp;
get $x-n, $act-n, $o-fp;
sort $o-fp asc;
limit 3;
group $o-fp;
----

The `get` clause filters the answers from the `match` clause to retrieve only the following:

* `$x-n`,
* `$act-n`,
* `$o-fp`.

Then we sort the results by the `$o-fp` in ascending order, limit the number of results to the first three, and
group the results by the `$o-fp` variable values.

====
The following or similar result can be obtained by running the query above without inference on the TypeDB server with
the IAM schema and dataset from the xref:home::quickstart.adoc[Quickstart guide].

[,typeql]
----
"LICENSE" isa path => {
    {
        $act-n "modify_file" isa name;
        $x-n "Pearle Goodman" isa full-name;
        $o-fp "LICENSE" isa path;
    }    {
        $act-n "modify_file" isa name;
        $x-n "Kevin Morrison" isa full-name;
        $o-fp "LICENSE" isa path;
    }
}
"README.md" isa path => {
    {
        $act-n "modify_file" isa name;
        $x-n "Pearle Goodman" isa full-name;
        $o-fp "README.md" isa path;
    }
