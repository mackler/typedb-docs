This page provides a guidance on how to define a schema of a database.
Instructions on this page are written in anticipation that you've read and followed the instructions from the
xref:typedb::connecting/overview.adoc[] and
xref:typedb::developing/creating-database.adoc[] pages.

== Define query

To define a schema of a database, use a Define query written in TypeQL.

[#_example]
.Define query example
[,typeql]
----
define

credential sub attribute, value string;
full-name sub attribute, value string;

subject sub entity,
    abstract,
    owns credential;
user sub subject;
person sub user, owns full-name;
----

The above example creates two attribute types and three entity types.
To be able to insert data with these types in mind,
you need to send this Define query to TypeDB and commit the transaction.
A Define query is validated for syntax, and the resulted schema is validated for consistency.

=== Send a Define query
[#_send_define_query]
To send a query to TypeDB, use any TypeDB client: TypeDB Studio, TypeDB Console, or language-specific drivers.
Select a TypeDB client below, and send the above query example, using the instructions provided below.

For more information on how to connect to TypeDB, open a session, and open a transaction, see the
xref:typedb::connecting/overview.adoc[] page.

Console::

. Open a `schema` session and `write` transaction to a new/empty database, for example:
+
[,bash]
----
transaction db1 schema write

. Copy-paste the <<_example,query example>> above and push btn:[Enter] *twice*.
. Commit the changes made in the transaction:

. Select a new/empty database from a drop-down list in the top toolbar next to the database icon
image:home::studio-icons/database.png[].
. Switch to the `schema` and `write` in the top toolbar's session and transaction type selectors.
. Create a new tab in TypeDB Studio text editor, copy-paste the <<_example,query example>> above.
. Execute the query by clicking on the btn:[Run Query] (image:home::studio-icons/run.png[]) button.
. Commit the changes with the btn:[Commit transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[]) button.

[#_extend_a_schema]
== Extend a schema

A Define query sent to a TypeDB database that already has a schema wouldn't overwrite it,
but rather add its statements to the existing schema.
That way an existing schema can be extended by adding new types, new properties to existing types,
new rules, or replacing existing rules.
For example, <<_send_define_query,send>>
the following Define query to extend the previously defined schema.

.Extending schema example
[,typeql]
----
define

id sub attribute, abstract, value string;
path sub id, value string;
email sub id, value string;
size-kb sub attribute, value long;

user owns email;

object sub entity,
    abstract;

file sub object,
    owns path,
    owns size-kb;
----

The above example creates some new types,
as well as adds ownership of the new `email` attribute type to the existing `user` type.

A Define query can't change existing schema statements except for annotations and rules.

=== Idempotency

Define queries are idempotent: sending the same Define query more than once produces the same result,
as sending it only once.
On top of that, schema statements can't be duplicated in a schema.
Hence, if the exact schema definition from a Define query exists in the schema already, this statement is ignored.

For example, send the following query.

[,typeql]
----
define

id sub attribute, abstract, value string;
path sub id, value string;
email sub id, value string;
size-kb sub attribute, value long;

user owns email;

object sub entity,
    abstract;

file sub object,
    owns path,
    owns size-kb;

name sub id, value string;
action sub entity, owns name;
operation sub action;
----

It contains all the statements from the previous one and three new types at the end.
As a result of this query, only three new types are added to the schema.
Sending it multiple times to the same database will produce the same result as sending it only once.

For more information on defining types and rules in a schema, see the
xref:typeql::schema/type-definitions.adoc[]
and xref:typeql::schema/rule-definitions.adoc[] pages.

[#_truncate_a_schema]
== Truncate a schema

A schema can be truncated by removing existing schema statements with an
xref:typeql::schema/undefine.adoc[Undefine query].

To delete a part of a type definition from a schema, use it in an Undefine query.

.Undefine example
[,typeql]
----
undefine

action owns name;
----

The above example deletes the ability to own the `name` type attributes by the `action` type entities.
Both `name` and `action` types are not deleted from a schema by this query.

=== Delete a type

To delete a type from a schema completely, use the `sub` keyword in the same statement as used for its creation.
For example, to delete the `action` type, that is a subtype of the `entity` type, use the following query:

.Undefine type example
[,typeql]
----
undefine

action sub entity;
----

The above query deletes the `action` type from a schema as long as the following conditions are met:

* The `action` type is a subtype of the `entity` type.
* The `action` type has no subtypes.
* There is no data in a database inserted with the `action` type.

Deleting a type also removes all references of the type in a schema, e.g., owned attribute types and roles played.

[#_undefine_subtype]
[IMPORTANT]
====
To be able to undefine a type, it needs to have no subtypes in a schema and no data in a database.
====

For more information on how to undefine types, see the xref:typeql::schema/undefine.adoc[] page.

[#_delete_rule]
=== Delete a rule

To undefine a rule, use the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
undefine

rule <rule-label>;
----

Undefining a rule does not require repeating its condition or conclusion.

=== Delete a schema

You can manually delete all user-defined types and all rules.
But that also requires deleting all data from a database.
It is usually easier to just delete the whole database and create a new one with the same name.

== Other modifications

=== Rename a type

To rename a type, use the TypeDB Studio's xref:typedb:ROOT:connecting/studio.adoc#_type_editor[type editor]
or TypeDB driver API methods.
//#todo Add tabs with code snippets and links to API ref?

=== Modify a rule

You can replace a rule with a new one by xref:typeql::schema/rule-definitions.adoc[defining a new rule]
with the same label as the old one.

== Learn more

After you defined a schema, you can xref:typedb::developing/write.adoc[write] some data to the database.
