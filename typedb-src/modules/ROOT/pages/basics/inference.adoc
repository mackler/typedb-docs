[#_inference]
TypeDB is capable of reasoning over data via rules xref:developing/defining-schema.adoc#_define_rules[defined] in the schema.

The reasoning engine uses <<_rules,rules>> as a set of logic to infer new data, based on the existence of patterns in
data of a TypeDB database.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Reasoning, or inference, is performed at a query time.

Only `read` transactions can use inference from rules.

The results are transaction-bound and are not persisted. As soon as transaction is closed -- all inference results
perish.
====

When executing a `get` query with the `infer` transaction option xref:developing/infer.adoc#_how_to_use_inference[enabled]
(`True`), TypeDB inspects and triggers rules that may lead to new answers to the query.

It returns data that answers the query taking into account inference results. Reasoning can proceed from one rule
to another, including recursion, leading to complex behaviors emerging from a few simple rules.

During a single transaction, inferred facts will be retained and reused (with corresponding performance gains).
These inferred data will be lost as soon as we close the transaction. A new transactions will re-compute inferred
facts again.

== Limitations

Inference works by rules defined in a schema of a database.

What's possible to infer is limited by what can be defined in a rule.
See the <<_rule_validation>> section for more information.

Read more on how to create rules in a schema in the xref:typedb::developing/defining-schema.adoc#_define_rules[Define rules]
section of the xref:typedb::developing/defining-schema.adoc[] page.

We can use xref:typeql::data/match.adoc#_computation[computation] operations and functions in the condition pattern.
And we can use value variables in the conclusion of a rule.
