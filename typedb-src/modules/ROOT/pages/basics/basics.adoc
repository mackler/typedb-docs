This page explains basic TypeDB terminology and operations required for anyone to continue learning how to use TypeDB.

== TypeDB

TypeDB is a polymorphic database with a conceptual data model, a strong subtyping system, a symbolic reasoning engine,
and a beautiful and elegant type-theoretic language: TypeQL.

TypeQL: :: Declarative query language.

//What is TypeDB
TypeDB: :: A transactional DBMS with queries in TypeQL.
//TypeDB is a transactional DBMS with xref:typedb::basics/acid-guarantees.adoc[].

//TypeDB editions
There are three editions of TypeDB: TypeDB Cloud, TypeDB Enterprise, and TypeDB Core.
All editions support the same set of query types and the same TypeQL syntax.
TypeDB Core can only be used for deploying standalone servers of TypeDB.
While other editions support clustering, replicating, load-balancing, encryption, and other enterprise features.

For more information on TypeDB editions comparison, see the https://typedb.com/deploy[Deploy] page of our website.

=== TypeDB Clients

//client-server architecture
//client role
TypeDB uses https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[TypeDB protocol], based on https://grpc.io/[gRPC],
to communicate queries and responses with TypeDB Clients.
TypeDB Clients are capable of connecting to a TypeDB server or cluster, validating and sending a query,
and retrieving an answer.

TypeDB Client: :: Any software capable of communicating with TypeDB through the TypeDB protocol.

A TypeDB Client can be built with an existing library that implements TypeDB Protocol and provides a native API
for interacting with TypeDB, queries, and answers.
We call such a library a TypeDB Driver.

TypeDB Driver: :: A language-specific library that implements the TypeDB protocol and provides a TypeDB Driver API.

TypeDB Drivers are also classified as TypeDB Clients, and used to create other TypeDB Clients, such as
xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio,window=_blank] and
xref:clients:ROOT:console.adoc[TypeDB Console,window=_blank].

== Database

//database data separation
TypeDB stores data in databases.
Every database has a name and consists of schema and data.
Schema is like a blueprint of data in a database.
One can define constraints on data and rules for reasoning in a schema.

Database: :: A named container for data with a schema.

Schema: :: A database schema is a full set of definitions for all types and rules used in the database.

A TypeDB server/cluster can store multiple databases, but is optimized for a small number of databases per server/cluster.
It is best to keep the number of databases in any given installation **under 10**.

For more information on how to create and manage databases, see the
xref:development/send-queries.adoc#_databases[Databases] section on the
xref:development/send-queries.adoc[] page.

//storage
//Physical persistent storage is implemented with https://www.speedb.io/[SpeedDB].
