TypeQL is a *declarative* query language used by TypeDB.

== Query types

There are different types of TypeQL queries:
xref:typeql::schema/type-definitions.adoc[Define] and
xref:typeql::schema/undefine.adoc[Undefine ]
are called schema queries,
xref:typeql::data/insert.adoc[Insert],
xref:typeql::data/delete.adoc[Delete],
xref:typeql::data/update.adoc[Update],
xref:typeql::data/fetch.adoc[Fetch], and
xref:typeql::data/get.adoc[Get]
are called data queries.

For more information on their clauses, see the links above, ot the full list on the xref:typeql::queries.adoc[] page.

== Syntax

A TypeQL query includes one, two, or three clauses.
Every clause starts with a keyword specifying a type of clause.
The rest of the clause is a pattern.
A pattern consists of one or multiple statements.
All statements in a pattern are combined with a conjunction (logical "AND").
There are special blocks for xref:typeql::data/match.adoc#_negation[negation]
and xref:typeql::data/match.adoc#_disjunction[disjunction].

For more information on patterns, see the xref:typedb::basics/polymorphic-patterns.adoc#_patterns[Patterns] section
on the Polymorphic patterns page.
