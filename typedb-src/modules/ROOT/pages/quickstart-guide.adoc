This Quickstart guide shows how to set up a TypeDB database and run queries.

== Prerequisites

[#_download_sample_data]
=== Download schema and data

For this Quickstart guide, you need to download and use the following files:

[#_iam_schema]
* link:https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-docs/blob/master/typedb-src/modules/ROOT/attachments/iam-schema.tql[iam-schema.tql,window=_blank]
  -- The TypeQL Define query for the IAM schema.
//* xref:attachment$iam-schema.tql[iam-schema.tql] -- The TypeQL Define query for the IAM schema.
[#_iam_microdataset]
* link:https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-docs/blob/master/typedb-src/modules/ROOT/attachments/iam-data.tql[iam-data.tql,window=_blank]
  -- TypeQL Insert queries for a sample dataset for the IAM schema.
//* xref:attachment$iam-data.tql[iam-data.tql] -- TypeQL Insert queries for a minimal dataset for the IAM schema.

=== Install and run TypeDB

Ensure you have TypeDB server (or cluster)
xref:installation.adoc#_install[installed,window=_blank] and
xref:installation.adoc#_start_the_server[running,window=_blank].

[#_typedb_client]
== Select a TypeDB Client to proceed

Choose either TypeDB Console (CLI) or TypeDB Studio (GUI) in the tabs below and complete all the steps.
We recommend familiarizing yourself with at least one of these two Clients, before trying to start developing
your own application with language-specific TypeDB Drivers.

[tabs]
====
TypeDB Console::
+
--
TypeDB Console is a TypeDB Client with CLI that is distributed and installed with TypeDB by default.

image::typedb::quickstart-console.png[TypeDB Console, width = 75%, link=self]

For more information on how to use it, see the xref:clients:ROOT:console.adoc[,window=_blank] page.
--
TypeDB Studio::
+
--
TypeDB Studio is a standalone TypeDB Client with GUI that needs to be
xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc#_download_install[installed]
and launched separately from a TypeDB server.

image::typedb::quickstart-studio.png[TypeDB Studio, width = 75%, link=self]

For more information on how to use it, see the xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc[,window=_blank] page.
--
====

== Connect to TypeDB

[tabs]
====
TypeDB Console::
+
--
By default, TypeDB Console will try to connect to `localhost:1729`.

.Server connection example
[,bash]
----
typedb console --server 127.0.0.1:1729
----

.Cluster connection example (TLS encryption enabled)
[,bash]
----
typedb console --cluster=i0.deployment-a4fa2444.cloud.typedb.com:1729 --username=admin --password --tls-enabled --tls-root-ca="/Users/username/typedb-cloud/typedb-cloud-root-ca.pem"
----
--
TypeDB Studio::
+
--
For TypeDB Core connection:

. Click btn:[Connect to TypeDB] on the right side of the toolbar.
//. Ensure the `TypeDB` option is selected in the *Server* field.
// We don't need that, because it is selected by default after new installation of Studio
. Enter TypeDB Core server address (e.g., `localhost:1729`) and click btn:[Connect].

For TypeDB Cloud or TypeDB Enterprise connection:

. Click btn:[Connect to TypeDB] on the right side of the toolbar.
. Select the `TypeDB Cluster` option in the *Server* field.
. Click btn:[Manage Cluster Addresses] and add the address for each known TypeDB Enterprise server in a cluster.
. Fill all other fields with appropriate information and click the btn:[Connect] button.

Select the folder with the <<_download_sample_data,downloaded TypeQL files>> as a
xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc#_open_a_project_directory[project directory,window=_blank] by clicking either:

* btn:[Open Project] in the *Project* panel (upper left); or
* Folder icon (the first icon on the top toolbar).
--
====

== Create a new database

[tabs]
====
TypeDB Console::
+
--
Assuming TypeDB server or cluster is running locally run:

[,bash]
----
typedb console --command="database create try-iam"
----
--
TypeDB Studio::
+
--
. Click the database icon (third button on the top toolbar).
+
image::studio-database.png[Database Manager button,width = 50%,link=self]
. Enter `try-iam` and click btn:[Create].
. Select `try-iam` from the database dropdown (to the right of the database icon).
--
====

[#_define_a_schema_from_a_file]
== Define a schema from a file

[tabs]
====
TypeDB Console::
+
--
[,bash]
----
typedb console --command="transaction try-iam schema write" --command="source iam-schema.tql" --command="commit"
----
--
TypeDB Studio::
+
--
Open the xref:typedb::attachment$iam-schema.tql[iam-schema.tql,window=_blank] file in TypeDB Studio.

Execute the Define query from the file:

. Ensure the Session toggle (`schema` / `data`) is set to `schema` and
  the Transaction toggle (`write` / `read`) is set to `write`.
. Click btn:[Run Query].
. When the query has completed, click btn:[Commit Transaction].
--
====

Now that the schema has been defined, data can be inserted into the database.

== Load data from a file

[tabs]
====
TypeDB Console::
+
--
[,bash]
----
typedb console --command="transaction try-iam data write" --command="source iam-data.tql" --command="commit"
----
--
TypeDB Studio::
+
--
Open the xref:attachment$iam-data.tql[iam-data.tql] file from the Project panel.

Execute all Insert queries from the file:

. Ensure the Session toggle is set to `data` and the Transaction toggle is set to `write`.
. Execute all queries in the file by clicking btn:[Run Query].
. When the queries have completed, click btn:[Commit Transaction].
--
====

Assuming there were no errors in the process, the data is persisted in the database.
The database is ready for queries now.
If you want, try some <<_query_examples,query examples>> below with the new database.

[NOTE]
====
The IAM schema and data from this Quickstart guide are used throughout the documentation.
====

[#_query_examples]
== Query examples

Try sending the following queries:

* <<#_get_query__retrieve_all_data>>
* <<#_get_query__retrieve_all_schema_types>>
* <<#_get_query__get_all_emails_of_kevin>>
* <<#_insert_query__add_a_new_email_for_kevin>>
* <<#_update_query__change_the_newly_added_email_for_kevin>>
* <<#_delete_query__delete_ownership_of_the_newly_updated_email_from_kevin>>

//#todo Replace the link below with a more specific one in a TypeQL section. Query types?
For more TypeQL query examples, check the xref:typeql:ROOT:overview.adoc[TypeQL] documentation.
//#todo Add the TypeDB in 20 queries page link

[#_get_query__retrieve_all_data]
=== Get all data

To retrieve all data from a database:

[,typeql]
----
match $t isa thing;
----

[#_get_query__retrieve_all_schema_types]
=== Get all types

To retrieve all types from a schema of a database:

[,typeql]
----
match $t sub thing;
----

[#_get_query__get_all_emails_of_kevin]
=== Get all emails of Kevin

To retrieve all emails owned by every person with a full name that contains "Kevin"
(we have only one such person in the example database):

[,typeql]
----
match
    $p isa person,
        has full-name $fn;
    $fn contains "Kevin";
    $p has email $e;
get $e;
----

[#_insert_query__add_a_new_email_for_kevin]
=== Insert a new email for Kevin

To insert a new email (`kevin@gmail.com`) for every person with a full name that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
    $p isa person,
        has full-name $fn;
    $fn contains "Kevin";
insert $p has email "kevin@gmail.com";
----

Now Kevin has more than one email.

[#_update_query__change_the_newly_added_email_for_kevin]
=== Update the email for Kevin

To update the email from `kevin@gmail.com` to `kevin2@gmail.com` for every person with a full name that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
    $p isa person,
        has full-name $fn,
        has email $e;
    $fn contains "Kevin";
    $e = "kevin@gmail.com";
delete $p has $e;
insert $p has email "kevin2@gmail.com";
----

The query above does the following:

- Matches the person and its email (`kevin@gmail.com`).
- Deletes the ownership by the person of the email.
- Inserts a new email (`kevin2@gmail.com`) owned by the person.

[#_delete_query__delete_ownership_of_the_newly_updated_email_from_kevin]
=== Delete ownership over the email for Kevin

To delete the ownership of the email "kevin2@gmail.com" for every person with a full name that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
    $p isa person,
        has full-name $fn,
        has email $e;
    $fn contains "Kevin";
    $e = "kevin2@gmail.com";
delete $p has $e;
----
