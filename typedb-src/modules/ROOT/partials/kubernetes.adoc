== Requirements
:!example-caption:
:tabs-sync-option:

* `kubectl` installed and configured for your Kubernetes deployment.
  You can use https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[minikube] for local testing.
* `helm` installed.

[#_initial_setup]
== Initial Setup

First, create a secret to access TypeDB Enterprise image on Docker Hub:

[,bash]
----
kubectl create secret docker-registry private-docker-hub --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v2/ \
--docker-username=USERNAME --docker-password='PASSWORD' --docker-email=EMAIL
----

You can use an
https://hub.docker.com/settings/security?generateToken=true[access token,window=_blank] instead of password.

Next, add the Vaticle Helm repo:

[,bash]
----
helm repo add vaticle https://repo.vaticle.com/repository/helm/
----

== Encryption setup (optional)
//*Create in-flight encryption certificates (optional)*

This step is necessary if you wish to deploy TypeDB Enterprise with in-flight encryption support.
There are two certificates that need to be configured: external certificate (TLS) and internal certificate (Curve).
The certificates need to be generated and then added to Kubernetes Secrets.

An external certificate can either be obtained from trusted third party providers such as
https://www.cloudflare.com/[CloudFlare] or https://letsencrypt.org/[letsencrypt.org].
Alternatively, it is also possible to generate it manually with a tool we provide with TypeDB Enterprise
in the `tool` directory:

[,bash]
----
java -jar encryption-gen.jar --ca-common-name=<x500-common-name> --hostname=<external-hostname>,<internal-hostname>
----

_Please note that an external certificate is always bound to URL address, not IP address._

The `encryption-gen.jar` generates three directories:

* `internal-ca` and `external-ca` -- The CA keypairs stored only in case you want to sign more certificates in the future.
* *<external-hostname>* -- A directory with certificates to be stored on all servers in the cluster.

All files from the directory
named after external domain shall be copied to the proper directory on every server in a cluster.
By default, they are stored in `/server/conf/encryption` inside the TypeDB Enterprise main directory.
For example, `typedb-enterprise-all-mac-x86_64-2.24.17/server/conf/encryption`.
The path to each file is configured in the `encryption` section of the TypeDB Enterprise config file.

Once the external and internal certificates are all generated, we can upload it to Kubernetes Secrets:

[,bash]
----
kubectl create secret generic typedb-enterprise \
   --from-file external-hostname/ext-grpc-certificate.pem \
   --from-file external-hostname/ext-grpc-private-key.pem \
   --from-file external-hostname/ext-grpc-root-ca.pem \
   --from-file external-hostname/int-grpc-certificate.pem \
   --from-file external-hostname/int-grpc-private-key.pem \
   --from-file external-hostname/int-grpc-root-ca.pem \
   --from-file external-hostname/int-zmq-private-key \
   --from-file external-hostname/int-zmq-public-key
----

Additionally, the secret name in Kubernetes Secret needs to be identical to the Helm release name (`typedb-enterprise`)
and contain all the keys from the folder named after external domain.

== K8s deployment

There are three alternative deployment modes that you can choose from:

* <<_deploying_a_private_cluster,Private Cluster>> -- For applications (clients) that are located within the same Kubernetes network as the cluster.
* <<_deploying_a_public_cluster,Public Cluster>> -- To access the cluster from outside the Kubernetes network.
* <<_deploying_a_public_cluster_minikube,Public Cluster (Minikube)>> -- To deploy a development cluster on your local machine.

[#_deploying_a_private_cluster]
=== Deploying a Private Cluster

This deployment mode is preferred if your application is located within the same Kubernetes network as the cluster.
In order to deploy in this mode, ensure that the `exposed` flag is set to `false`.

.In-flight encryption
[tabs]
====
Without encryption::
+
--
Deploy:

[,bash]
----
helm install typedb-enterprise vaticle/typedb-enterprise --set "exposed=false,encrypted=false"
----
--

With encryption::
+
--
Ensure the external certificate is bound to `\*.<helm-release-name>`.
For example, for a Helm release named `typedb-enterprise`, the certificate needs to be bound to `*.typedb-enterprise`.

To enable in-flight encryption for your private cluster, make sure the `encrypted` flag is set to `true`:

[,bash]
----
helm install typedb-enterprise vaticle/typedb-enterprise --set "exposed=false,encrypted=true"
----
--
====

The servers will be accessible via the internal hostname within the Kubernetes network,
i.e.,
`typedb-enterprise-0.typedb-enterprise`,
`typedb-enterprise-1.typedb-enterprise`, and
`typedb-enterprise-2.typedb-enterprise`.

[#_deploying_a_public_cluster]
=== Deploying a Public Cluster

This deployment mode is preferred if you need to access the cluster from outside the Kubernetes network.
For example,
if you need to access the cluster from TypeDB Studio or TypeDB Console running on your local machine.

Deploying a public cluster can be done by setting the `exposed` flag to `true`.

Technically, the servers are made public by binding each one to a `LoadBalancer` instance which is assigned a public
IP/hostname. The IP/hostname assignments are done automatically by the cloud provider that the Kubernetes platform is
running on.

.In-flight encryption
[tabs]
====
Without encryption::
+
--
Deploy:

[,bash]
----
helm install typedb-enterprise vaticle/typedb-enterprise --set "exposed=true"
----

Once the deployment has completed, the servers would be accessible via public IPs/hostnames assigned to the Kubernetes
`LoadBalancer` services.
The addresses can be obtained with this command:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get svc -l external-ip-for=typedb-enterprise \
-o='custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,IP OR HOSTNAME:.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].*'
----
--

With encryption::
+
--
To enable in-flight encryption, the servers must be assigned URL addresses.
This restriction comes from the fact that external certificates must be bound to a domain name, and not IP address.

Given a "domain name" and "Helm release name", The address structure of the servers will follow the specified format:

[,bash]
----
typedb-enterprise-{0..n}.<helm-release-name>.<domain-name>
----

The format must be taken into account when generating the external certificate of all servers such that they're properly
bound to the address.
For example, you can generate an external certificate using wildcard, i.e.,
`*.<helm-release-name>.<domain-name>`, that can be shared by all servers.

Once the domain name and external certificate has been configured accordingly, we can proceed to perform the deployment.
Ensure that the `encrypted` flag is set to `true` and the `domain` flag set accordingly.

[,bash]
----
helm install typedb-enterprise vaticle/typedb-enterprise --set "exposed=true,encrypted=true,domain=<domain-name>"
----

After the deployment has been completed, we need to configure these URL addresses to correctly point to the servers.
This can be done by configuring the `A record` (for IPs) or `CNAME record` (for hostnames) of all the servers in your
trusted DNS provider:

[,bash]
----
typedb-enterprise-0.typedb-enterprise.example.com => <public IP/hostname of typedb-enterprise-0 service>
typedb-enterprise-1.typedb-enterprise.example.com => <public IP/hostname of typedb-enterprise-1 service>
typedb-enterprise-2.typedb-enterprise.example.com => <public IP/hostname of typedb-enterprise-2 service>

[#_deploying_a_public_cluster_minikube]
=== Deploying a Public Cluster with Minikube

This deployment mode is primarily intended for development purposes as it runs a K8s cluster locally.
Please note that in-flight encryption _cannot_ be enabled in this configuration.

////
Certain adjustments will be made compared to other deployment modes:

* Minikube only has a single K8s node, so `singlePodPerNode` needs to be set to `false`
* Minikube's K8s node only has as much CPUs as the local machine:
`kubectl get node/minikube -o=jsonpath='{.status.allocatable.cpu}'`.
Therefore, for deploying a cluster with three servers of TypeDB Enterprise to a node with 8 vCPUs,
the `cpu` can be set to `2` at maximum.
* Storage size probably needs to be tweaked from default value of `100Gi` (or fully disabled persistent)
  as total storage required is `storage.size` multiplied by `replicas`.
  In our example, the total storage requirement is 30Gi.
////

Ensure to have https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/[Minikube] installed and running.

Deploy, adjusting the parameters for CPU and storage to run on a local machine:

[,bash]
----
helm install typedb-enterprise vaticle/typedb-enterprise --set image.pullPolicy=Always,servers=3,singlePodPerNode=false,cpu=1,storage.persistent=false,storage.size=1Gi,exposed=true,javaopts=-Xmx4G --set encryption.enable=false
----

////
[,bash]
----
helm install vaticle/typedb-enterprise --generate-name \
--set "cpu=2,replicas=3,singlePodPerNode=false,storage.persistent=true,storage.size=10Gi,exposed=true"
----
////

Once the deployment has completed, enable tunneling from another terminal:

[,bash]
----
minikube tunnel
----

== K8s cluster status check

To check the status of a cluster:

[,bash]
----
kubectl describe sts typedb-enterprise
----

It should show `Pods Status` field as `Running` for all the nodes after a few minutes
after deploying a TypeDB Enterprise cluster.

You can connect to a pod:

[,bash]
----
kubectl exec --stdin --tty typedb-enterprise-0 -- /bin/bash
----

== K8s cluster removal

To stop and remove K8s cluster from Kubernetes, run:

[,bash]
----
helm uninstall typedb-enterprise
----

== Helm configuration reference

== K8s troubleshooting

To see pod details for the `typedb-enterprise-0` pod:

[,bash]
----
kubectl describe pod typedb-enterprise-0
----

The following are the common error scenarios and how to troubleshoot them.

=== All pods are stuck in `ErrImagePull` or `ImagePullBackOff` state

This means the secret to pull the image from Docker Hub has not been created.
Make sure you've followed <<_initial_setup,Initial Setup>> instructions and verify that the pull secret is present by
executing `kubectl get secret/private-docker-hub`. Correct state looks like this:

[,bash]
----
 $ kubectl get secret/private-docker-hub
 NAME                 TYPE                             DATA   AGE
 private-docker-hub   kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson   1      11d
----

=== One or more pods of TypeDB Enterprise are stuck in `Pending` state

This might mean pods requested more resources than available.
To check if that's the case, run
`kubectl describe pod/typedb-enterprise-0` on a stuck pod (e.g. `typedb-enterprise-0`).
Error message similar to
`0/1 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient cpu.` or
`0/1 nodes are available: 1 pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims.`
indicates that `cpu` or `storage.size` values need to be decreased.

=== One or more pods of TypeDB Enterprise are stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff` state

This might indicate any misconfiguration of TypeDB Enterprise.
Please obtain the logs by executing
`kubectl logs pod/typedb-enterprise-0` and share them with TypeDB Enterprise developers.

= Current Limitations

TypeDB Enterprise doesn't support dynamic reconfiguration of server count without restarting all the servers.
