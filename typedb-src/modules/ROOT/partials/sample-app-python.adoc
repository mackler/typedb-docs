The following Python script executes four simple requests to the `iam` database.

We can save it locally and run it with https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python,window=_blank] v.3.9+. Make sure to
install the xref:clients:ROOT:python-driver/overview.adoc[TypeDB Python Driver] with pip.

Use the source code below or the xref:tutorials/sample-app.adoc#_explanation[explanation] section to explore four
requests performed in the sample app.
