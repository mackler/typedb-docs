This Quickstart guide shows how to set up a TypeDB database and run queries.

include::home::overview.adoc[tag=rust-rewrite]

== Run TypeDB

To start TypeDB, select the TypeDB edition below and follow the instructions.

[tabs]
====
Cloud::
+
--
include::home::install.adoc[tag=cloud-run]

include::home::install.adoc[tag=self-hosted-run]
--

Core::
+
--
TypeDB Core needs to be xref:home::install.adoc#_core[installed] first.

[#_typedb_studio]
== Connect with TypeDB Studio
// tag::run_studio[]
TypeDB Studio is a standalone TypeDB Client with GUI that needs to be
xref:home::install.adoc#_studio[installed] and launched separately from a TypeDB server.

Find the TypeDB Studio binary and run it.
Click btn:[Connect to TypeDB] on the right side of the top toolbar.
// end::run_studio[]
//image::quickstart-studio.png[TypeDB Studio, width = 75%, link=self]
// tag::connect_studio[]
[tabs]
====
Cloud::
+
--
image::home::studio-connect-cloud.png[TypeDB Studio connect window, width = 75%, link=self]

. Switch the `Server` field drop-down to `TypeDB Cloud`.
. Click btn:[Manage Cloud Addresses] button and add address and port for every server
from your TypeDB Cloud deployment.
Close the Address management window.
. Fill in the `Username` (default: `admin`) and `Password` (default: `password`) fields.
. Turn on the `Enable TLS` option and leave the `CA Certificate` field empty.
_For self-hosted deployments, encryption parameters may vary._
. Click `Connect`.

[NOTE]
=====
On your first login you will be asked to change the password for the `admin` account.
A TypeDB Cloud deployment will refuse queries until the password is changed from its default value.
=====

Core::

image::home::studio-connect-core.png[TypeDB Studio connect window, width = 75%, link=self]

Enter TypeDB Core server address (e.g., `localhost:1729`) and click btn:[Connect].
--
====
// end::connect_studio[]

== Select a project folder

Select a xref:typedb:ROOT:connecting/studio.adoc#_select_a_project_directory[project directory]
to store project files by clicking either:

* btn:[Open Project] in the *Project* panel; or
* Folder icon (image:home::studio-icons/project.png[]) in the top toolbar.

[#_create_a_database]
== Create a new database

Create a database to play with:

. Click the database icon (image:home::studio-icons/database.png[]) in the top toolbar.
. Enter a name for a new database, for example, `typedb-1`, and click btn:[Create].
. Select the new database from the dropdown to the right of the database icon.

[#_define_a_schema]
== Define a schema

A new database needs a schema before we can load any data:

. Ensure the Session toggle (`schema` / `data`) is set to `schema` and
  the Transaction toggle (`write` / `read`) is set to `write`.
. Open a new tab and copy-paste the following Define query:
+
[,typeql]
----
include::attachment$quickstart-schema.tql[]
----
. Click btn:[Run Query] (image:home::studio-icons/run.png[]).
. When the query has completed, click btn:[Commit Transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[]).

Now that the schema has been defined, data can be inserted into the database.

== Load data

Now let's insert some sample data into the newly created database to be able to query in future steps:

. Ensure the Session toggle is set to `data` and the Transaction toggle is set to `write`.
. Open a new tab and copy-paste the following Insert queries:
+
[,typeql]
----
include::attachment$quickstart-data.tql[]
----
. Execute all queries in the file by clicking btn:[Run Query] (image:home::studio-icons/run.png[]).
. When the queries have completed, click btn:[Commit Transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[]).

Assuming there were no errors in the process, the data is persisted in the database.

== Finish

Congratulations on completing the TypeDB quickstart guide!
Now you can try sending your first queries to the database.
We have prepared some simple <<_query_examples,query examples>> for you to try.

To learn about TypeDB's advanced and unique features such as
polymorphic queries,
type inference,
type inheritance,
rule-based reasoning,
and n-ary relations, we recommend you check the <<_learn_more>> section.

[#_query_examples]
== Query examples

Try sending the following queries:

* <<#_list_people>>
* <<#_get_query_all_instances_and_attributes>>
* <<#_fetch_all_emails_of_kevin>>
* <<#_insert_email_for_kevin>>
* <<#_update_email_for_kevin>>
* <<#_delete_email_from_kevin>>

//#todo Replace the link below with a more specific one in a TypeQL section. Query types?
For more TypeQL query examples, check the xref:home::25-queries.adoc[] page or the
xref:typeql:ROOT:overview.adoc[TypeQL] documentation section.


[#_list_people]
=== List names and emails

To retrieve full names and emails of all instances of the `person` type you can do:

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person;
fetch $p: full-name, email;
----

For every person in a database,
the above xref:typeql::data/fetch.adoc[Fetch] query returns a JSON object similar to the following example:

.Result example
[,js]
----
{
    "p": {
        "email": [ { "value": "kevin.morrison@vaticle.com", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "email", "root": "attribute" } } ],
        "full-name": [ { "value": "Kevin Morrison", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "full-name", "root": "attribute" } } ],
        "type": { "label": "person", "root": "entity" }
    }
}
----

[#_get_query_all_instances_and_attributes]
=== Get all instances of a type and their attributes

To xref:typeql::data/get.adoc[get] all instances of a `person` type with all attributes owned:

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has $a;
get $p, $a;
----

The above xref:typeql::data/get.adoc[Get] query returns concepts from a database as a ConceptMap
that can be used programmatically with a xref:drivers::overview.adoc#_typedb_drivers[Driver API] to process the result.
The following image is a graph visualization produced by xref:typedb:ROOT:connecting/studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio].

image::quickstart-get-example.png[Quickstart Get query example, role=framed, width = 75%, link=self]

[#_fetch_all_emails_of_kevin]
=== Fetch all emails of Kevin

To xref:typeql::data/fetch.adoc[fetch] all emails
owned by every person with a full name that contains substring `Kevin`:

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $fn;
$fn contains "Kevin";
fetch $p as person: email as "E-mail address";
----

The above query returns a single JSON object (we have only one such person in the example database)
that looks as the following:

.Result example
[,js]
----
{
    "person": {
        "E-mail address": [ { "value": "kevin.morrison@vaticle.com", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "email", "root": "attribute" } } ],
        "type": { "label": "person", "root": "entity" }
    }
}
----

[#_insert_email_for_kevin]
=== Insert a new email for Kevin

To xref:typedb::developing/write.adoc#_insert[insert] a new email (`kevin@gmail.com`) for every person with a full name
that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $fn;
$fn contains "Kevin";
insert $p has email "kevin@gmail.com";
----

Now Kevin has more than one email.

[#_update_email_for_kevin]
=== Update the email for Kevin

To xref:typedb::developing/write.adoc#_update_query[update] the email from `kevin@gmail.com` to `kevin2@gmail.com`
for every person with a full name that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has full-name $fn,
    has email $e;
$fn contains "Kevin";
$e = "kevin@gmail.com";
delete
$p has $e;
insert
$p has email "kevin2@gmail.com";
----

The query above does the following:

- Matches the person and its email (`kevin@gmail.com`).
- Deletes the ownership by the person of the email.
- Inserts a new email (`kevin2@gmail.com`) owned by the person.

[#_delete_email_from_kevin]
=== Delete ownership over the email for Kevin

To xref:typedb::developing/write.adoc#_delete_query[delete] the ownership of the email `kevin2@gmail.com`
for every person with a full name that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has full-name $fn,
    has email $e;
$fn contains "Kevin";
$e = "kevin2@gmail.com";
delete
$p has $e;
----

== Repeat with TypeDB Console

xref:typedb:ROOT:connecting/console.adoc[TypeDB Console] is usually distributed with TypeDB.
You can find it with the TypeDB or xref:home::install.adoc#_console[install] it separately.

[#_console_run]
[#_console_connect]
=== Run TypeDB Console

[tabs]
====
Cloud::
+
--
.TypeDB Cloud connection
[,bash]
----
typedb console --cloud=<server-address> --username=<username> --password --tls-enabled=true
----

You will be prompted for a password.

include::typedb::connecting/console.adoc[tags=cloud-psw]
